Thompson (\\""The flamboyant apostle and avatar of Gonzo Journalism \\"" -- New York Times) were there. For Satterwhite's beautifully produced and articulate limited-edition photographic book, Cozumel Diaries, SnapChats you back to the days of \\""Drugs, Sex and Rock 'n Roll.\\""<br /><br />Cozumel Diaries `setting: Thompson sitting -- on his own terms -- for his famous Playboy interview (included, in its entirety, in the book) in Cozumel, Mexico; this is also the period that Hunter researches The Great Shark Hunt. Captured as laid-back and casual, Thompson is not yet the personage he is to become. (Which will, ironically, lay destruction to his \\""invisible\\"" reportorial persona-- and thus lead to his downfall.)<br /><br />The photographs (many from the Playboy sessions) faithfully capture Thompson as he approaches the peak of his glory with the publication of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, and Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72.<br /><br />Satterwhite's text and pictorials channel perfectly Thompson's first-person, edge-of-the-knife perspective.

After each of 3 charging sessions lasting 8 - 12 hours the charge lasted less than 4 hours. Within seconds after the device was disconnected from the charger, the charge level indicator dropped from 100 to 75%. The battery I received is certainly a dudd. Take a chance -- if you like, maybe your luck will be better.<br /><br />Update: 12/6/2013:  Alright, I was annoyed with my purchase and thought I had made a poor choice.  I then tried to charge the battery using a charger with higher current USB capacity (1.5A.) After this the battery lasted a full 14 hours in my GPS while paddling between islands in the 10000 Island National Park. It is possible that current limiting circuitry in lower power chargers shut them down so that the battery never gets a charge if using a charger without adequate horsepower.  Try a charger designed for the CR-V3 Li rechargeable or a high current USB power supply before you decide to toss out the battery.<br /><br />New Update 5-21-2014. The battery has been used maybe 2 or 3 times a month, with full recharge before and after usage but now the battery is lasting only about 2 to 2.5 hours at best. I had better expectations for this from early experience. Currently unavailable (today anyway) means no great loss. Look for a better item.",10/29/2013

This case was perfect. It was reasonably small enough to stash in a purse or travel bag. The shell is sturdy enough to keep the iPod (or whatever you want to put in there) from getting crushed. There are mesh pockets on the inside (both sides) so wires and earbuds can be stored in there as well. There is a little opening at the top that you can use if you want to listen to music and leave your iPod/iPhone in the case. The opening is made so you can (tightly) thread the headphone wire through, but even if you're not using it, dust and dirt don't get through. The description said this is waterproof as well, but nobody is willing to throw it in water or douse it to see, so I can't comment on that.<br /><br />All in all, a good case. I actually purchased it last fall, but am just writing the review now.

(Meaning, that you're going to have to know all about eyepieces focal lengths so 50mm equals this and 25mm equals that and blah blah blah. How inspiring for our young astronomers, huh?) okay so one, it takes like forever to calibrate. (I don't calibrate it anymore when I use it) Two, after giving up trying to calibrate, I had to manually find a bright star and focus on it. Then I realized that I needed to take out more money ($190) from the piggy bank and buy the eyepieces to ACTUALLY see distant bodies. (actually the moon is the ONLY thing you can see with the default eyepiece) I tried to look at a Jupiter (big and bright so I can't miss out on detail here) with all the new six different eyepieces and guess what guys? It looks like a white dot BUT CLOSER. (The same case with ALL other objects) I made a lot of research on my telescope but I guess you gotta have an ph in astronomy and be almighty smart to understand telescopes. But boy am I glad I spent all that money just to see a white dot wow I feel accomplished. Unless you're dedicated and want to go to your local autonomy club  ΓÇö hahahah *ahem* sorry ΓÇö Save your money and buy binoculars instead cause I can gaureentee that it will not work better but will definitely save you some time and money if you wanna see upclose white dots and little of the moon.",12/9/2014

In hindsight using the 283  proved no real great handicap and was perfectly adequate for fill-in flash for the important bride, bride and groom , shots. Since then there have always been a 283 or two amongst my collection of photographic 'stuff' that has snowballed over the years. My regular use of a Vivitar 283 was, however, curtailed in 1986 with the purchase of my first Olympus OM4. It was then I learned about trigger voltages !!! First time on my OM4, the 283 fried the Olympus circuit boards, much to the amusement of my local dealer who explained replacement wasn't going to be a F.O.C. warranty repair . After that the 283 was restricted to my OM1 and similar all-mechanical camera bodies.<br /><br />Despite this issue of trigger voltage, which I'm told can be addressed with modification by anyone into electronics, the 283 is a well-made piece of equipment. Both its built-in sensor and the optional SC-1 remote sensor give very accurate flash control on all the power settings. Best of all, there are masses of old 283 guns for sale really cheap . Definitely not for use, unmodified, on a DSLR or any other electronic dependent piece of kit , mine are now restricted to rare use on an old OM1 and a Yashica FX-2. Ideal and recommended for any keen all-mechanical SLR user/student of film photography .",6/26/2015

Use in colder temperatures.<br /><br />Cons: Won't really read beyond 400 yards. Laser can be picky on targets and acclimation.<br /><br />Not bad at all for the money. The glass is clear and sharp. The laser worked well within 400 yards on certain targets and the Zip and Rain features actually work very well. The Scan feature picks up the targets well within 300 yards, however I just cant seem to get the laser to acclimate on targets well between 300-400 yards, and it won't reach at all past 400 yards. The laser can be picky on certain targets like buildings and trees.<br /><br />Overall it is a good product for the money, but not a steal. You can find other rangefinders at better prices.",1/23/2014

My first telescope was a $50, 60mm Bushnell refractor I received for Christmas.  I still have that scope.  Almost every amateur astronomer will tell you, &#34;don't buy this scope.  It will not track, it will not guide, it will not goto.  Buy a pair of binoculars first.&#34;  This is like telling someone &#34;don't buy a car, buy a model and put it together first.&#34;  Yeah.  That's not what youΓÇÖre wanting.  That money is burning a hole right through your pocket.  I do not give this scope a 5 star on its performance.  I give it a 2 star on getting you interested.  Either, you will be hooked on astronomy or you will sell. Most people sell this scope.<br /><br />I do not recommend doing this.  I cannot stress enough:  Contact your local astronomy club first.  Go out and view with them.  There is nothing more satisfying to a club member than showing off his new equipment.  You get to look through scopes ranging from this scope to scopes costing thousands of dollars, free.  Once you see if astronomy is for you, then, you can look through the many different type of scopes and make an intelligent decision as to what you really want.  I started with a 60mm and finally built an observatory officially discovering 58 asteroids.  I, along with every member, is learning something new every day.  I'm 65 and love the hobby.",4/6/2015

The difference is the excellent Olympus lens.You won't be able to enlarge much past 8x10, without losing some quality, but the color balance and sharpness are really better than many newer cameras.<br /><br />There are several useful features on this camera that aren't typically found elsewhere. For example: The camera uses both SM (smart media) and CF (compact flash memory cards). If you install both, fill one and then switch to the other at the push of a button. The camera can shoot and store RAW images, if you like to manipulate them, and it uses good old AA batteries, for easy replacement and low cost. I use rechargeables. There are some add on lenses to give a bit more telephoto or wide angle pictures. The Olympus branded ones are excellent.<br /><br />These cameras were Very Expensive when they first appeared.

Whenever I attend an event such as a get-together, a party or (especially) a concert, I still tend to have a disposable camera on hand [usually Kodak or Fujifilm]. Only downside with using a 35mm disposable camera as such is that you need to make sure / do whatever it takes to be within - say ten to twenty feet from the subject, plus be sure to use the flash when permitted. Otherwise, you're taking the chance of your photo(s) either not turning out at all or frustratingly under-exposed. Fully realize that I should now go digital - but I've (seen way) too many other patron's digital pics turn out -too- fuzzy and / or downright lousy. Plus, with using a disposable camera, the camera itself with quality processing will usually cost you around $15 or more.

It is a great price,"This was my first lens, and was the catalyst for my photography love. It is a great price, and will suffice to any photographer's needs (in its focal range). It taught me some of the most important lessons I've ever learned in the photographic realm. First, don't fall into the marketing scheme. There's many lenses in this price range that will provide beautiful images. Canon just wants you to keep spending money on lenses that are not necessary for 95% of the population, they are a business, not you're friend. Second, the first thing you should do as a photographer is find your style. Identify what makes you unique and explore the vast cosmos of photography. Don't listen to single word of the pretentious glass snobs' that are fixated on futile passions. Like Henri Cartier Bresson said, &#34;Sharpness is a bourgeois concept.&#34; Sorry if I ranted, but I wish I had known this going into the game.

The lens focuses SUPER (amazingly) fast and very quietly on all my Rebel cameras (t5i, t4i, t3i, etc. [all my Rebel gear is APS-C]).  Used in aperture priority mode, this lens really SHINES.  Set it at f11 and forget it or open it wide up on a tripod or monopod and play around - the results are super sharp (and surprisingly so) for the price.  Compared to L glass, the color is not as vibrant on my copy especially leaning red and the contrast in low light is funky on this lens, but sometimes funky can be good (almost arty)! Play around and have fun!  Great lens to play with for VERY little money, and a real GEM at f11. Buy it for less than $40 and you can't go wrong!",7/24/2013

Ahh, film.<br /><br />I have since graduated to a 24-70 f/2.8L II for this focal length range and I photograph professionally now. I couldn't have made it to where I am now without using this little guy, but it honestly wasn't very good. It wasn't very sharp, it has a variable aperture across the focal length range, it produces washed out colors, contrast is a little flat, and the bokeh doesn't look nice. All that being said, for less than one hundred dollars, this is a good deal. The autofocus speed is loud and slow, but you'll find that this lens serves an important purpose: it is a first lens. It will teach you how to compose, hand hold without IS, and manual focus. Those are all important skills.<br /><br />I know that there are better lenses that exist for a first lens, but none of them are as affordable as this little lens. For the price, this is a good deal. I'd also recommend it to someone who has child that wants to try photography, and you don't want to be too concerned that the lens will be destroyed by accident.<br /><br />Oh, I should also mention that I won a competition with a photograph of a baseball with this lens in 1998.

What I mean is that there is a piece of glass that covers the foot of the lens which prevents dirt and moisture from getting inside well dust anyway. The housing is really cheap plastic and the motor is painfully loud oh my this thing is loud. I would not try to use it in a setting where noise is an issue because this thing would wake the dead in a grave yard. It does take okay shots this would make a great lens for a child because they are cheap and if it gets broke your only out like 40 bucks.,7/28/2013

There is some colour distortion and image distortion when used wide open, so I suggest f8, f11 when edge to edge image quality is at it's best.<br /><br />I have used it both on a full frame and APS-C sensor body and found the increased focal length on the C-sensor to be very useful as it then acts as a 105mm to 480mm lens equivalent. However with the increased megapixels of the full frame body it is stil possible to crop centre sections of the image for enlargement to 10x8 or even 15x12 prints..<br /><br />It has limitations on the speed of autofocus taking considerably longer than an L series lens, but with careful planning will give good results even with relatively quick subject movement.<br /><br />In summary I would say if you just need an occasional mid tele zoom, or are on a budget you wont be disappointed if you use this lens carefully and within it's boundaries.",9/24/2013

I'm still a newbie to photography but I have been doing my research.<br /><br />I am realized pleased with the ease in which it zooms, you can really notice the difference that the USM makes. Now I get annoyed with my kit lens that doesn't have the USM! It's so quick and much quieter, great when you are trying to focus on wildlife- I don't have the time or patience to wait for my camera to auto focus, but the auto focus on this lens is awesome!<br /><br />It doesn't have the image stabilization, but that brings down the price which is great if you are looking to save some money, Maybe I'm not experienced enough to really see the difference that image stabilization makes, but I haven't been bothered with not having it.<br /><br />What's also really cool about this lens is that you can use it for some simple astrophotography. With the right settings at 300mm, you can take a nice picture to differentiate Jupiter and some of it's moons! The Orion Nebula is also within reach, among other objects that I'm not aware of, I'm sure.",12/28/2013

I find it's very soft at the 300mm lens length. It is slow, f4 is the fastest at 70mm and f5.6 at the full telephoto.<br /><br />I tried it in various situations:<br /><br />1. For nature photography, I was grabbing a shot of a rare bird while hiking. It was not a great photo. The softness was annoying, though I got an acceptable enough shot for identification. IS (Image Stabilization) would have helped in this application, but this lens doesn't have that added feature.<br /><br />2. I put it on a very stable [[ASIN:B00CF1LS94 AmazonBasics 70-inch Adjustable Pistol Grip Head Tripod]] which is not a hiker's tripod but a very heavy, 10lb beast of a tripod that is going nowhere when you set it up. I photographed the moon at 300mm, using a remote shutter release. I didn't stop down the lens (perhaps that would have been better) but I was using a 1/10 second exposure and shakes happen even on tripods. The photo was sharp enough to see craters at the edge of sunlight on the surface, but they weren't razor sharp. The entire effect was soft (admittedly, we have pollution and it was a cloudy morning.)<br /><br />You pretty much have to use a tripod with this lens unless it's brilliant sun outside and even then...<br /><br />If you must have this length (and it is a handy one for sports and even candid portraits) then it's a budget choice. But compared to my 55-250mm, it's a lot softer and just not quite \\""the thing.\\""",12/22/2013

And then someone (Chuck Berry, Jimmy Hendrix?) heard it and decided something like 'this is a really cool innovative sound, I am going to overdrive my amp on purpose'.<br /><br />I got this lens refurbished, for about half of its already low price listed here, so having it was kind of a no-brainer at this price point. But I would not dream of having this lens as a main or the only telephoto lens. If all you want to do is to take sharp factual (adorable but artless) sports or wildlife shots, this lens is downright terrible. In addition to already-mentioned noticeable amount of vignetting (dark corners) and the lack of image stabilization that has to be compensated by using very short shutter speeds, which in turn makes your camera go very high on ISO and thus cause a lot of noise, this baby also has an insane amount of chromatic aberration - a magenta or green outlines on the edges of high contrast in the scene (so much, in fact, that leafless branches shot against the sky backdrop produce a picture with branches being a veritable rainbow of color).<br /><br />So with all its noise, vignetting and chromatic aberration, let's ask ourselves, what would Jimmy Hendrix do? You got it - he'd embrace it and make something everyone else would imitate and follow. Got noise? Make grungy grainy shots. Chromatic aberration? Great! Shoot B&W, or even better, go for as much of chromatic aberration as possible as an artistic tool, just say something with it. And that's a pretty good reason to have this lens in your kit.

I read plenty of reviews and most of them talked about how the amount of sharpness gets really low when you get around 300mm. This is true. From my testing, 75-200mm seems to be the sweet spots for this lens. I shot a few pictures out in the woods at 75mm f/4 of my Dad and the bokeh was pretty awesome. I also shot some pictures of birds at 300mm and it's just very unsharp the second you crop. The only way I've found to get good bird shots is to be really close to them. This is very difficult unless you're at a popular park where the birds are fairly used to humans. Here is a picture I took at 300mm and is only very slightly cropped [...] I was only a few feet from this bird. As you can see it's a sharp image due to VERY minimal cropping. It is difficult to fill the frame with these little birds let alone get close to them. Here is another bird at the same exact place [...] This was shot at 155mm, it was at Clingman's Dome in Gatlinburg which is a very popular place which makes these birds fairly used to humans. I put down some nuts right next to myself and it walked right up and took them and that's how I got this picture.<br /><br />Pros and Cons<br /><br />Pros:<br />Takes great portraits at 75mm<br />Very inexpensive for what it is<br />Fairly well built for the price<br /><br />Cons:<br />You lose almost all sharpness once you crop above 250mm<br />The zooming is not very smooth<br /><br />Overall, who would I recommend this to?<br /><br />I would recommend this to any beginner photographer who wants to take pictures of their family or friends that may also enjoying wildlife photography. This would also be a great lens for someone who doesn't really care much about photography but wants a nice zoom lens to sit on their porch and take pictures of wildlife from far away (birds, deer, etc)<br /><br />TL;DR: Overall great value, absolutely worth the buy.",6/18/2014

It got the job done.  At the time, it was a serviceable lens, and it served me well.  However, these days, it would be a poor choice for pretty much anyone, because there are other lenses at a similar price point that are much better.<br /><br />This lens has three major limitations:<br /><br />1.  It focuses *very slowly*.  This makes it cranky under the best of circumstances.  If you get into low light and it hunts, you'll be waiting for ten or fifteen seconds for it to go all the way around.<br /><br />2.  This lens has no IS.  Depending on your camera's maximum usable ISO, it may be quite difficult to get usable shots handheld without image stabilization at such a long zoom range, though a better camera can help in that regard by allowing you to use a faster shutter speed.<br /><br />3.  The lens is *amazingly* soft.  This isn't an autofocus accuracy issue; this lens is incapable of producing a sharp picture even if you're pointing it at a brick wall in full sun with a tripod and take ten test shots in a row, focusing between each shot.<br /><br />IMO, if you are on a crop body you're *much* better off with the 55ΓÇô250.  It is only slightly more expensive, has IS, and has so much less chromatic aberration and is so much sharper that even after you upscale the images to make up for the loss in reach, you'll still end up with significantly better pictures.",11/10/2014

Overall the lens is great for beginners because of its long zoom range, Light weight, and Very low price. Now before I dive into the full review of the lens I must say this in my opinion of this lens which should not be your deciding vote on wether to buy it or not. In my finding I have found that the aperture is not that big of a problem if you are shooting in bright light and do not care or know about Depth Of Field. Another thing I should point out is that the absence of IS is not a prblem for even fast moving objects Because if you shoot in manual, TV (Shutter Speed Priority) by just keep your shutter Speed Higher than your focal Length. An example would be if you are zoomed out to 300 mm and you want non-blurry photos you would should at a shutter speed of 1/300 sec or faster and then compensate your apeture and ISO. Now if one does not have good enough lighting to use said settings then that is where most people dont like the lens and good lighting would be just average daylight.<br /><br />The AF system is a problem but not too much where one cannot use it for sports. I will admit that the AF system does hunt like an amazonian hunter (HUH! AMAZONian) But if you pre-focus the you can get around the slightly slow AF. If you dont know what pre-focusing that is when you focus on something in the range of what you want to shoot and wait for the action at that distance.<br /><br />Now on to the quality of the lens it-self in terms of the picture quality now that all the technical stuff is out the way. Ok so I shoot with a Canon T5i which is a lower end crop sensor but it is great and what most people buying this lens will have (REBEL). Recently I shot a Childs football game in the setting sun and again in mid-day sun and in both occassions I had noticed extreme lens abberation (the green and purple stuff that shows on vertical objects) which would have made the photos unuseable if i did not have adobe Lightroom and could correct it now before you say anything I know abberation is specific to what you get but in my experience it is a drawback to this lens do to the glass in it. Before i get to negative I would like to say other than the lens abberation its has great color recreation and clarity for its price range. Also if you are skilled enoughyou can use it as a macro lens and it is also a great lens for portraits if you cannot afford a 70-200 is usm f2.8 which is some hefty, excellent, and expensive glass.<br /><br />Before iI forget lets talk about build quality it is plastic which for some of you sonds bad but its not because as long as you are not to hard on it, it will treat you right, also if you are thinking about using this for video DON'T , UNLESS you plan on filling in the video sound with music and you use manual focus because it is loud and the auto focus is very jerky. Now if you are looking for a great video lens the I would look at the STM series from canon.

If you are looking for something that operates much like your kit lens, this lens would seem like a natural choice. However, if you have made the jump from point and shoot/cameraphone photography to a DSLR, you can find more bang for your buck by pursuing other avenues.<br /><br />Since most people will be looking at this lens to supplement their kit lens, or maybe their 50mm 1.8, and aren't looking for Canon's newest $1000 L lens, this is written in direct comparison to similar lenses in the $100-350 range.<br /><br />It's not all bad<br />*It is worth noting that this is the most inexpensive of the available telephoto lenses, particularly when considering the used market. One can be purchased for between $80-100.<br />*It is the lightest of the telephoto lenses to carry. On long days with a camera around your neck, its not terribly burdensome to carry.<br />*From 70mm-200mm the lens is equal to or less than competitor lenses in sharpness.<br />*There is little distortion across the entire focal range. Distortion can easily be fixed in post production, but many shooters considering this lens would likely prefer not to finagle with Lightroom and Photoshop to edit all their images.<br /><br />Just mostly bad:<br />* A very slow focus speed makes it difficult to capture moving subjects. Sports, wildlife (particularly birds), and running children are very difficult to do well.<br />* Even when the auto focus is fast enough, it is often inaccurate, meaning a plethora of bad shots.<br />* Images are soft across the entire frame, even when on a tripod, or shooting still subjects. Sharpness deteriorates rapidly after 200mm. Shots at 300mm are often downright blurry. This problem is made worse by the lack of image stabilization that is available on competitor lenses.<br />* Forget about shooting anything inside. The camera struggles mightily to lock focus in dull lighting. The minimum 5.6 aperture on the long end (300mm) also requires slow shutter speeds (or very high ISOs).<br />* Lack of image stabilization makes it extremely difficult to take handheld shots between 200-300mm unless shooting in ideal lighting conditions (outside in the bright sunshine). Otherwise get ready to crank up your ISO, introducing additional grain into your images.<br />* There is a very noticeable lack of contrast in images compared to other lenses. Images appear flat, and colors are subdued.<br />* Chromatic Aberation is high and noticeable between 200mm-300mm. Chromatic aberation refers to \\""fringing\\"" due to the construction of the glass elements in a lens. It produces purple and green lines along the edges of subjects in your images.<br /><br />It's one thing for a budget conscious photographer or someone new to the game to gamble $80 on a used copy of this lens. If you are considering purchasing new at $199.99, choose the Tamron 70-300 instead for the same price. You get a noticeable increase in Image Quality, it focuses much faster and more accurately, and you get image stabilization (or vibration control as Tamron likes to call it). If you want to stick with Canon you can spend an additional ~$50 for the Canon 55-250 and get IS and better image quality. If money is less of an issue in your purchasing decision, you can jump up to the 70-200 f/4 for around $500.

Highly recommended for beginner to intermediate photographers.  Best choice for the second lens you purchase.<br /><br />The Canon EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 III USM should be a strong contender for the second lens you own for your Canon DSLR camera.  Your first lens was probably a kit lens, typically a standard zoom lens that has a range starting around 20mm and goes to around 80mm, give or take a bit.  You've enjoyed that lens, but you're looking for something else...something with more distance, something you can really zoom in to see the action.  You want a telephoto lens.  (You're also probably wanting a wide angle zoom lens, something that will pull in that grand vista in front of you...that's a different review, but also a good choice for a second or third lens).<br /><br />So you start looking at all the different lenses out there, trying to find the best one for your money so you can take those photos you've been dreaming of taking.  But it gets confusing.  So many numbers.  You're just starting out, and you're wanting to make art, not do math problems!  And so many different opinions!  What is best?<br /><br />So here's my two cents.  It's biased, like everyone else's opinions here, but I'll try to tell you what I'm thinking and why.<br /><br />First, pick a lens that goes with your camera.  If you own a Canon camera, in the long run you'll be happier with Canon lenses.  I've owned a few other brands for my Canon cameras, but they've sometimes disappointed me.  Canon lenses usually don't.  There are several reasons for this, but the most practical is that your camera is a system.  The Canon camera &#34;talks&#34; electronically to the Canon lens and the Canon flash best, so if you're using *any* automatic settings, you'll get the best results using Canon products.  You *can* get just as good of photos using different lenses and different flashes...but you have to do all the work of communicating with the system by using manual settings.  Not a problem if you know what you're doing, but if you're new...you'll want to use Canon products to help with the workload and learning curve.  Even if you're experienced, it just makes everything significantly easier.  So, I'm biased there, but you at least know where I'm coming from.  My wife calls it &#34;lazy,&#34; I prefer to call it &#34;efficient.&#34;<br /><br />Next you need to think about what you want to do with the lens.  Since you're looking at this lens, you're probably thinking you want something that will give you the ability to take photos of things far away, or at least make something that looks small look a lot bigger in your photo.  A telephoto lens will do this.  For me, at least, this was the perfect second lens option.  Getting futher away from things usually was easier than getting closer, especially with wildlife.  So what kind of telephoto do you need?  For most folks starting out, a zoom telephoto (as opposed to a prime focus telephoto) is a better option...it allows you to zoom in and out, and better frame the photo you'll take.  So you'll be looking for a lens that shows a range of focal lengths (say, picking some random numbers....75mm-300mm).  The trade-off is that you'll have larger focal ratio (f-stop, f-number...it's called lots of things), which means you'll need longer shutter speeds but that's going to hold true for all zooms.  Image stablization will help with that some, but in practice if you're using bright light (like sunlight) I haven't found it makes that much difference and it costs significantly more.<br /><br />So that brings us to this lens.  It's an inexpensive telephoto zoom lens compared to other lenses out there.  It's no frills, and does the job.  It's also more light weight than most telephoto zoom lenses out there, which helps when you're holding the lens and camera by hand (remember, higher focal ratios mean longer shutter speeds...meaning you have to be more steady for longer).  Yes, there are &#34;better&#34; telephoto lenses out there...but you'll pay more for them.  And the big secret?  You'll not get that much better photos.  Don't get me wrong, I have some &#34;L&#34; lenses as well, and they're wonderful...but I don't necessarily get better photos from them.  I've had the Canon EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 III USM lens for almost 20 years, and I've taken some amazing photos with this lens.  Why?  Because I take a lot of photos, so I have a lot of practice with it.  It also helps having steady hands (although being a doctor and an expert military marksman means I have some practice there) and/or a tripod, but really there is no substitue for practice.  That goes for any lens, but if you're new to SLR photography, a good inexpensive lens like this to practice with will more than pay for itself.<br /><br />Telephoto lens.  Light weight.  Inexpensive.  Good quality.  You can ask for more, but you'll pay for it.  This one does the trick and works well.  Great to start with, and the skills you'll develop will translate when (if ever) you upgrade.ady for longer).

The first pair was purchased in 2007, and are in great condition optically.  So why would I spend almost $400 for a second pair?  Because the rubber coating is \\""melting\\"".  By melting, I mean it is softening and has ripples in it.  I knew this was happening a few years ago, because I noticed some of the shirts I was wearing were developing stains on the front, and it finally dawned on me that the stains were located right where the binoculars were rubbing against my shirts while strapped via harness to my body.  The black rubber coating was rubbing off and staining black marks on my shirt!<br />So is this crazy problem unique to me?  No. If you go online, or read reviews on Amazon, you will see others have had the same problem I have.  When I contacted Canon a month ago, I asked if there was any compensation or help, since my warrenty had expired.  The rep said no, except that I could send the binoculars in, and they would send me a repair bill after recoating the body.  Well, I have learned from other users who followed this path that the recoating process would cost almost $400, which is about the same as getting a new pair.  By the way, the Canon rep said he had been with Canon for 10 years, and never heard of this problem.  Well, if he was truthful, he should go on the internet!<br />Why would I buy a new pair after my bad experience?  Because these have got to be about the greatest binoculars ever made.  Just read all the gushing 5 star reviews on Amazon and elsewhere.  I love these binoculars for birding.  For astronomy, they are unique.  You look a Jupiter, and turn on the IS, and it is rock steady, and you can see 4 moons.  And you don't need a tripod!<br />They are relatively light.  The optical quality is superb!<br />What causes a binocular coating to melt?  There are several reasons, all of which affected my Canons.  First, I live in hot humid Florida.  When I transport my Canonsin a car, they get hot.  I don't leave them in  the car permanently, but it's hard to avoid the hot temps,  Second, I use sunscreen and Deet bug repellant.  It got from my hands to the Canons. This may be the biggest cause of melting. Also, I used alcohol wipes to clean the lenses, and stupidly used them to clean the sweat off the rubber coating-bad move.<br />I am enjoying my new Canons, and will treat them differently.<br />WARNING:<br />Don't get sunscreen, Deet or other repellants on the Canons.<br />Don't clean the body with any chemicals-water or mild soap only.<br />Don't subject them to a hot car, or any heat source.<br />Somebody else may have other advice to offer, and it would be appreciated.<br />You cannot find an image stabilized binocular of this quality with fine optics at anywhere near this price.

The 10 x 42s went clear down to 8.5 feet. But I haven't found this to be too problematic  so far. The Canon 10 x 42s are water proof these are not. There doesn't seem to be a practical way to put caps on the front of these as there is no screw threads and it is 35mm in diameter. Like others have suggested you would do better to get a small camera type case for the thing. I keep mine in a Pelican case right now. Breaking it out and hanging it around my neck when I need it. The strap Is quite comfortable. I rigged mine up with clips for quick removal.<br />Optical quality seems to be really good. and the 6┬║ field of view seems huge. Puts things right up in your face.

Have tested it out hiking and in vehicles with good results. It is especially helpful after a long day in the field when you are tired of holding an optic up all day. Only issue so far is small exit pupil (3mm), which means you have to stat lined up squarely on the ocular lens or image shadowing takes place.

I already owned a pair and he thought they were awesome. I knew the Canon 10x30 stabilizer binoculars would make the perfect gift for hunting. I got the best deal on the internet with Amazon, at the lowest price with free shipping. I received the item in 2 days and was stunned at the lightning speed at which it arrived. Canon stabilizing binoculars are phenomenal in that they far exceed the more grossly expensive brands at an affordable price. Bottom line, it doesn't matter how good the quality of the glass is, if your shaking and moving around like a flag on a pole, chances are you will not clearly see what you are looking at. With the Canon, you just push the button, and it basically freeze frames the picture. In my humble opinion, it eliminates at least 85% to 95% of movement caused by shaking hands, or movement caused by high winds. In other words, with a steady view, you are able to focus in on your subject and see details with outstanding clarity, comparable to high dollar binoculars such as Steiner. As a hunter, the Canon stabilizing binoculars are at the same level as my rifle, as far as a necessity when hunting. They allow me to better asses game at great distances, as to whether they meet trophy standards.

For him they work well. His tremor is not severe but definitely makes birding impossible without the use of these binoculars.

Honestly good edge to edge IMO, although I'm sure not as good as expensive glass. But I'm very confident the IS is worth FAR more than expensive glass for resolving fine detail.<br /><br />I wish the stabilization button locked, but it's easy to push so honestly not an issue. If I were birding or something where I was looking through them for very long periods, I would probably rig something but for our use, it's fine.

Images are quite crisp, sharp, contrasty and saturated. Only optical issue I see is a bit too much flare when you point in the general direction of the sun. I feel that longer lens shades or better internal coatings could have helped here.<br /><br />The image stabilization works wonders, and if you stand reasonably still you get a rock-solid image. Quite a feat for a 10x binocular...the image is way steadier than I can get out of my older 6x binocular. Still, it's not magic - if you're standing on (say) a moving boat in the wind and expecting a totally stable image, you're going to be frustrated. About the only solution there is less magnification.<br /><br />As far as construction quality, these are also topnotch. The unit itself feels sturdy and made to last, and everything operates smoothly and evenly. The image stabilization motor is so quiet you can't really tell it's in use - when I first activated it, I actually thought the batteries were dead. Speaking of batteries, you get a reasonable amount of life out of conventional batteries, but I've opted for lithium cells - they seem to be lasting forever.<br /><br />With only a 30mm lens and 10x magnification, these can be a bit dark for nighttime use. Most of my needs are in daylight, but if I wanted something more suited for dark conditions, I think I'd definitely be looking at the 10x50 version of this product. Still, the 10x30 size makes for a good balance of magnification and small size - a 10x50 is likely twice the weight and bulk.<br /><br />The provided case and strap are so-so...I would have preferred a case with more padding, or perhaps a small waterproof hard case. The strap is your typical camera strap, but it was hard to attach and didn't really have a wide enough range of adjustments. These are easily fixed issues, however.<br /><br />Generally, these are among the best binoculars in this size, power and price range, and you can't go wrong with them - definitely worth a try.",4/11/2015

I use them constantly (professionally (biologist) and personally) and have purchased a half dozen pairs over the years for my own use, for my wife, and as gifts. The 10 X 30 seems to be the most useful of the lot for most wildlife viewing; also have an 8 x 20 and a 15 x 50 (I have not tried the more expensive and heavier 10 x 42).  The 15 x 50 is a much larger, heavier, more expensive glass, and gains surprisingly little in resolution over the 10 x 30 in most circumstances.<br /><br />Like other reviewers, I was blown away when I first blundered into these glasses while killing time in a camera store many years ago. I was initially concerned about durability, but recognized their tremendous advantage and had to have them. In general, they have held up very well in hard use.  None of them has had an electronic or an alignment issue, though I take care to keep them from getting seriously wet. The two problems that I have had over the years are the wearing through of the rather soft coating on the ocular lenses through normal cleaning, even with cotton balls (though this seems to have little effect on image quality) and more aggravatingly, the battery door (a flimsy piece of crap) has come apart on three of the 10 x 30s so far.  The first pair was repaired by Canon for an outrageous price (over a hundred dollars many years ago); the subsequent two units received my own cruder, but more positive, and satisfying home brew repair.<br /><br />Using these yields an image that is not quite as stable as a conventional glass on a tripod, but is a very good surrogate, and you will agree is a hell of a lot more practical and convenient!",12/6/2014

I am a licensed mechanical engineer, that does not make me a expert on binoculars but I know bad design when I see it. My rubber encased eyepiece  which has the neck strap loop on it separated from the main binocular body. This happened because of mechanical failure of the fasteners due to bad design. I am very careful with these binoculars and they have never had any treatment resembling abuse. This is indeed inadequate design and will eventually happen to many if not all in use, If this were a automobile then there should have been a recall. Canon should fix it for free. See the other review for comments, he is precisely correct there.<br /><br />But of course Canon will not fix it for free, but not only that there repair process is horrible. I realize that Canon could care less but this is my last Canon product after having a similar bad experience with several of their cameras over the years. Their attitude is \\""we know our products have flaws but if you do not like them then do not buy them\\"".<br /><br />I have capitulated.<br /><br />Edited: I have to admit that I was too harsh here in giving only one star, I have raised to three. My previous comments are accurate with the exception of the number of failures. I would like to add that with careful handling these binos could last the full lifetime. Also, I will not be using the neckstrap with mine but that may be overkill... again, with careful handling they should be satisfactory. Also, the optics, image, etc are really stunning. But, if you do use the neckstrap a lot and particularly if you were to handle them by the neckstrap in such a way that the (fairly significant) weight of them were carried by only one side of the strap instead of both then this issue could occur. If you see inside them and think of the full weight of the bino being supported by these three tiny screws and more importantly the very thin plastic that holds the screw threads you would I think agree.<br /><br />If you are really interested in the design issue then I could provide you with extensive data. I have ordered the part from Canon and repaired them myself, this is not something that everyone should attempt though. Some special tools, precautions and skills are required. I would be willing to provide photos of the exact design issue if desired, might also be willing to assist you in repair or even do it for you for a fee if you need that done and do not want to send to Canon.

I have ordered the part from Canon and repaired them myself, this is not something that everyone should attempt though. Some special tools, precautions and skills are required.

Probably not the best starter scope in the world.  It is a little tricky to align, especially because Meade doesn't include a finderscope (I put a Daisy BB gun laser heads-up display on top of mine, works great). It's light almost to the point of being unstable, fixed that by hanging a dumbell weight from the hook on the bottom. Also the supplied eyepieces aren't the greatest. And if you try to use anything other than new batteries it may slip a gear while slewing. But these are minor, fixable issues (just get the BB gun heads-up display, a dumbell, some Plossl eyepieces and some Duracells). Optics not bad at all, just a narrow field of vision. It won't track objects smoothly enough for astrophotography but adequately enough for viewing. Mine will track Jupiter for about a half hour before losing it.

Just point to something interesting and the computer will figure out what you're seeing and tell you about it. Recently I aimed at a blank area of sky and found a wide cluster of stars called Caldwell 15. It was so sharp and magnificent that I had to gasp out loud! This scope is so easy to use that any first-timer can be finding stars and planets in just a couple of minutes. It comes with three eye-pieces, a tripod, built-in Barlow lens, erector lens, lens cover, glare hood, and more. Just a couple of short-comings: There is no finder-scope, and the focus knob is a bit small and tedious to use, especially when switching to the Barlow lens, which requires about a dozen turns of the focus knob.

My biggest complaint is the fiddly litttle focusing knob on the back. It's wedged in there and takes forever to rack in and out. There needs to be a course and fine focus and an extension.

This flash is amazing.  I'll never give it up, and now I'm thinking of buying a second one for backup. I have only one issue with it.  When the battery power gets low (I use rechargeable batteries), the color temperature dips dramatically. I don't have a color temperature meter, but my guess would be anywhere between 3,800 - 4,200K.

This ISO 400 film is a great general purpose film that works well both indoors and outdoors.  If you plan on shooting exclusively outdoors or in very well lit areas, you might get a slightly better picture quality with an ISO 100 or 200 speed film, but its 2014, and if you're still shooting film, you probably already know this.<br /><br />Ken Rockwell raves about Fuji Velvia 50 film, but that film is considerably more expensive than this Fuji Superia X-TRA 400.<br /><br />Ironically, Amazon sells single rolls of Kodak film for less than the average cost of this 4-pack, but Amazon considers the Kodak film to be an &#34;Add-On Item&#34;, which means you can only order a maximum of 3 rolls at a time.  If you need more, you have to get a different type of film, so I got this.  At just under $3 a roll, its still a bargain.  The incredibly sad thing is, however, that very few places develop film anymore.  You can't just go to your local Walgreens or CVS Pharmacy and have them develop film.  The ones that will do it, will send it out to a lab, and from what I've read online, the results vary dramatically.  Its luck of the draw whether or not the person developing your film knows what they're doing.<br /><br />If you want your film developed by someone who has a lot of experience with film and uses quality equipment, for most people your best option is one of the online sources where you mail in your film to do it, but the costs are high.  You will pay anywhere between $10 - $25 for a single roll of film to be developed which is in start contrast to how it used to be where your corner drug store would do it for $5 - $6 a roll.",5/8/2014

I'm a traditionalist, I love the look of analog over digital.<br /><br />Fuji 800 is a nice film stock in my opinion.  I like to see grain and slightly flat colors.  I don't mean that in a critical way, Fuji absolutely retains color information in the negative (which can be brought out easily in Photoshop - one of the digital era tools that I do love)  Since it has a wide latitude, you can shoot in relatively low light situations while still getting a fair amount of quality.  You will see a good amount of grain, but this is what I love about analog film.  It's got a more rustic quality to it, and isn't cringe-worthy like that of digital noise.<br /><br />Sharpness, colors, detail... all this of course depends on what camera you are using, lenses, and the subject.  I used this for more of a travel-journalistic approach and have found that because of it's latitude you can easily shoot in many light situations without the hassle of too much adjusting.  With proper lighting setups, then this film easily will provide you with what you need for decent 35mm prints (let's be honest, you can't blow up 35 too much anyway)  For \\""better\\"" image detail with less grain, then opt for the 2 or 400 speed film.  Of course, you will not have the benefit of being able to shoot with less light.<br /><br />Great price.  Also pretty damn near impossible to find hour developing places anymore!",8/28/2013

The film looked as if it was never exposed to light because both negatives were completely blank. Worst is that I called Fujifilm to tell them and the customer service guy for disposable cameras insisted aomething must have been done wrog while developing or that I didn't use it correctly (how many people can mess up using tis camera when you don't even have to load the film?). He said he's been workinghwith fujifilm for a whopping 2 years and was the only one handling the customer service for disposable cameras and has never heard a complaint like mine (guess he should read these reviews huh?). In addition, he didn't even bother to ask the lot number or anything in case there was a problem in production like I pointed out. He claimed as long as the expiration date was fine that was all that mattered. I was extremely disappointed with the customer service at Fujifilm. I expected much more from such a large company.

I wasn't ready to send him with a digital camera, so I went to Amazon to have something delivered by the day of the trip. The camera itself was great. Didn't take great photos indoors in dim lighting, but other than that the photos were great. The strap was great as he was able to hold onto the camera much easier. These are definitely cheaper other places, but for a working mom like me, having it delivered to the door in less than two days was definitely worth the few extra bucks spent here versus a big box store.<br /><br />I think I'll invest in a cheap, small digital camera for the future. Probably 60% of his photos didn't turn out for whatever reason, so it was a pain to have them developed only to find out they were terrible pictures.

This has been everything I hoped for and more.  I love the ease and accessibility of having this in front of me and not having to take off a pack to get at my gear, or having to deal with the weight of something hanging around my neck.  I've since graduated to a D90, and that with the 18-200 still just fits.  I have the Nikon 70-300 lens too, and that does not fit.  If I have a smaller lens I could wear this all day with no discomfort.  my lower back does get a tad sore if I'm toting the 18-200 lens around all day, but it's manageable.  If I am hiking and wearing a day pack with a waistband, I fasten the waistband under this and it does wonders to take the pressure off of my lower back!  One additional feature of this that I like is being able to slide it around 180 degrees and wear it backward if the occasion demands.  for instance if I was doing some climbing and it would be in the way or if I'm on my road bike.  and yet when I want it it's easy to slide around to the front.  when in back the weight is also supported by my butt, so it's surprisingly comfortable to wear it that way..  I've had this now for many years and it has literally been all over the world with me and has held up very well.",11/10/2014

Although they pan fairly smoothly for the price, I mostly use these for holding relatively fixed camcorders.  I aim the camera at a particular position on the stage and leave it there for a few minutes while I pan around with a more expensive Bogen rig.  Then at a convenient time I move the camera on the Velbon to point at a different part of the stage.  Sometimes I have all three of my Velbons within arms reach so that I can keep adjusting the area that each camera is covering during the performance.<br /><br />I really like these tripods.  They are lightweight but relatively sturdy.  When travelling by air I can throw one of these in my suitcase and use it when I get to my destination.  It isn't as smooth or as steady as my Bogen setups, but you can get very good results with it.<br /><br />There are some things that I don't like about the units.  The first is that they don't work very well with the column extended.  When extended more than a very short amount, the plastic extension column will vibrate/oscillate for a while any time you bump the tripod.  When I re-position the tripod and then let go of the handle, I often get 4-5 seconds of unusable video because the camera is vibrating.  Even the anti-shake features of my cams can't compensate for the motion.  Worse yet, people walking on wooden floors cause the cameras on the end of the columns to start vibrating.  The bottom line is that unless you are on a concrete floor you can't reliably use these tripods fully extended.  The column can only be extended a few inches before this effect comes into play.  This is pretty limiting because the tripods aren't all that tall to begin with.<br /><br />The second problem has to do with the friction knob that restricts the motion when the camera is panning up and down.  It is a small knob, and very difficult to tighten the needed amount.  My cameras are very lightweight, and it is still difficult to tighten theseknobs enough to keep the cameras from tipping forward or back when you take your hand off of the control handle.<br /><br />The bottom line is that these tripods are the best that I have found anywhere near this price for my specific needs. But they do have their quirks which you need to be aware of if you want to capture professional quality video.",3/24/2014

It's light enough to carry hiking, and it's got indoor and outdoor feet built in. It's got the bubble level and adjustable friction on the fluid pan/tilt mechanisms. It's stiff enough to be used as a periscope with a 3lb camera attached (grab all three legs together with two hands and hold camera up over a crowd).It survives a lot of banging around and the head is solid - but after dropping it from hand height onto the concrete one of the leg extension locks broke. They have some strange tiny pieces of plastic inside- seems unnecessarily complicated and flimsy. I replaced it with parts ordered on the phone from velbon. Two years later another one broke - I think the airline smashed my luggage that the tripod was in.<br /><br />So here's the three issues that make it short of perfect:<br />Leg extension locks should be redesigned without tiny flimsy plastic parts inside.<br />It isn't as light and compact as some tripods are.<br />It's cheap but not free.<br /><br />So handle with reasonable care, buy a spare if you're a pro, and enjoy.",10/6/2013

Also, it is much easier for me than holding the camera in my hand, or on a monopod. I am very happy with this purchase. The tripod folds up nicely and is very easy to carry in its case.",2/27/2014

It's been almost 13 years since I've first got my hands on it, and I regret nothing.  Sure, it was a pricy cheap bodied camera in '02, but it always took great pictures (especially in challenging situations).  It was my first Leica and I plan to use it until there's no film left on Earth.  Seriously, the photos from this camera are sharp, contrasty when you want it, and offers enough shooting options.  If there is something bad about it, it's the flimsy plastic (cheap looking), loud lens motor (typical P&S) and the constant button pressing to get the right flash/exposure setting.  Other than that, it's served me well around the world.",2/3/2015

One must remember that these are 'sub-compact' binoculars and therefore it is not a fair comparison to compare them with other larger, heavier, high quality binoculars.  I also use several other high quality 8X binoculars when weight & size are not an issue but I specifically bought this Minox BD 8x24 for sub-compact, ultra-light weight quality & convenience and I am very pleased with them for what they are.  One must ask, what is the best binocular?..  answer: the one you have with you!  And this Minox 8x24 will be with me much of the time when I don't want to carry my larger, heavier binoculars.  When weight & size are not an issue, sure I will probably use one of my larger, heavier binoculars especially in low-light situations.  But these Minox 8x24 are high quality and excellent for lightweight travel, hiking etc. especially for use in adequate daylight.  When size & weight are less important, buy/use a high quality 8x42 binocular (or other) that are better suited for low-light viewing but they will be much larger & heavier.  To test or compare any binocular, view a target object in LOW LIGHT and larger, quality binoculars are designed to perform better in low light situations but are much heavier and less suitable for lightweight convenience.  This Minox 8x24 binocular is sub-compact, ultra-lightweight, high quality, excellent and will work great in adequate daylight but has inherent low light limitations.  This Minox 8x24 binocular also comes with an &#34;unlimited 30-year warranty&#34; - I hope I never need to use it!  I am very satisfied and would recommend & repurchase this product.",9/21/2014

I read several good reviews of this camera on photography sites from when the camera was brand-new and top-of-the-line and the overwhelming message was &#34;easy and great pictures.&#34; So far, it's delivered. The film auto-loads, so Dad (and I) has confidence that the film is in properly. The buttons on the front zoom in and zoom out so, while it takes him a second to fat-finger which button is which, he's only got 2 options and it's pretty obvious which one he's landed on. It's got a very long cord, so he can wear it around his neck; not stylish, I'll admit, but he's always got in within reach. And, most importantly, it auto-rewinds so when he's done, he can easily pop out the roll of film and take it to be developed (&#34;Look, I can see the pictures I took!&#34;).

Then we decided to move away from the office and leave our cell phones in the office as well so the only things we had on us was the camera, the mic system and ourselves. The buzz / hum disappeared and the sound quality was really good.<br /><br />Clipping the mic to your collar isn't super great so try to clip it mid-chest or shirt breast pocket. Or if you're sitting at a table, just lay it on the table if you're able to do so out of frame and in front of the person.<br /><br />I will probably be outgrowing this system soon but for anyone first starting out, this is really a good system for the price and seemingly under the conditions I listed above.",10/16/2014

It does work, but the problem is the VHF.  It'll work alright if you find a good spot in the room for reception and everything holds really still, but if you or the person wearing the mic move even the tiniest little bit, it will invariably drop into a dead zone and you'll get terrible audio.  The audio quality itself also isn't stellar.<br /><br />My advice: Either figure out some other method for audio capture (e.g. shotgun mic), or invest in a UHF wireless system.  VHF just doesn't cut it.

I love the rubber part design but hate the plastic holder that should have been metal to last. I guess, it was Canon's intention, as most companies' today to ensure a constant cash flow for spare parts. The eye piece needs to be moved up for film manipulation, and this periodic &#34;exercise&#34; eventually causes the plastic to fail.

Low angle or studio setups often require the camera at a height that is uncomfortable for critical focusing or depth of field preview. Using this relieves that problem. The eyepiece rotates 360 degrees around the camera eyepiece so it can be used in many awkward angles. The increased magnification setting is also very handy for those critical focusing and DOF situations. Of course, this is best suited for a tripod setup, but one can get used to it as a waist-level viewer same as a Hasselblad.",2/18/2014

I went to put it onto my Canon EOS 70D and a small piece broke off of the eyepiece.  I am adding a photo to show where it happened.  I bought this particular viewer because it was an authentic Canon article.  Unfortunately, it is not very well made.  Mainly plastic with a few metal frames.  I spoke with the seller to find out if there was any way I could just replace the eyepiece and they weren't sure.  They did try to help me out however, giving me suggestions of a possible source.  After some searching and nothing coming up, I glued the piece back on with &#34;Gorilla&#34; super glue and it appears to be holding.  Now, with a complete piece I was able to attach the viewer to my camera.  I find it to be very loose and un-sturdy.  When I try to look through the viewer, the setting moves.

At 6'2&#34; I have to stoop over to do good portraiture work. Taking a picture from too high and the image is out of proportion and not flattering. Having the angle finder allows me a much more comfortable stance. I took the adapter on a photo trip to Yosemite and it made night and landscape photography easer where I no longer had to depend on the active display (not easy to see in bright light, or ruins your night vision in the dark) or smash your face against your tripod.<br /><br />I was surprised that it works well with my glasses. I usually use a cup adapter on my viewfinder so I can get a good view but it wasn't necessary with the angle finder. I also found that it's diopter adjustment has more range and I could adjust it far enough so I could use it without my glasses.<br /><br />It came with two viewfinder adapters, the smaller is the right size for the Canon 5d models as well as many of the modern EOS models (check compatibility). I was happy to find that the larger adapter was the right size for my old Canon EOS A2 film camera so I didn't have to purchase any additional adapters.<br /><br />The only problem I ran into is how easy it is to knock the level that selects 1.25x and 2.5x out of its setting. Multiple times I'd bring the camera to my eye to find the image cropped (magnification on) or in a way I can't get into focus (level in between the two settings).<br /><br />Pros:<br />* Clear viewfinder that shows the image the right way around (not like old TLR cameras with a standard top side viewers)<br />* Sturdy connection to the viewfinder adapter.<br /><br />Cons:<br />* Too easy to change from 1.25x to 2.5x magnification when you don't mean it",5/25/2015

Both 430's fired consistently without a single miss for about 50 shots.  Apparently, as long as the signal from this can bounce off of something, it will work fine with no direct line of site (there is a wall close to my patio door that the ste2 was pointed at).  Unless you're doing the majority of your shooting outdoors, do yourself a favor and try this one out before jumping to the ste3/600 ex.  You can still use this one to trigger the new 600ex off camera  (according to Canon's website), but of course you won't have the radio wave capability.<br /><br />Highly recommend the ST-E2!",2/17/2015

All these devices include an autofocus assist beam, which is nice, because my EOS 5D3 and 1D4 bodies do not have flashes or AF lights. Sometimes I use the ST-E2 purely for that feature alone.  Speedlite 580EX II (bought December 2009)  This is a very reliable, easy-to-use flash. It replaced a Speedlite 550EX, which was quite complicated to operate. Unlike the old 550EX, you push in one button and you can tilt and swivel the flash head with ease. The flash recharges quickly and gets lots of shots out of a set of batteries (see note). The flash can act as a master or slave with another Speedlite via infrared; I use it with the SE-E2 below. ItΓÇÖs a bright flash, with a guide number of 190ft. The zoom on this flash is 24-105mm, or 14mm with the extendable panel. I keep this flash in ΓÇ£slaveΓÇ¥ mode.  The 600 below is much easier to use and more versatile. However, if you can pick up a 580EX II for a good price, it makes a good slave ΓÇö assuming of course that youΓÇÖre controlling via infrared. If you might want to go radio frequency, itΓÇÖs of no use unless you use a Pocket Wizard or some such.  Speedlite 600EX-RT (bought July 2012)  This is the flash I use most often, because itΓÇÖs slightly brighter, and the automatic zoom has the best range. (Though in practice, I canΓÇÖt see the difference in brightness compared with the 580EX II.)  Both have the one-button release for tilting and swiveling. Although this flashΓÇÖs specs say that itΓÇÖs a little bit brighter than the older model, with a guide number of 197ft, in practice itΓÇÖs the same. I like the width of the coverage, from 20mm-200mm, with the extendable panel bringing it to 14mm.  The 600EX-RT can work as a master/slave with either infrared or radio frequency. IΓÇÖm committed to infrared because I have the ST-E2 master (which is infrared, as opposed to the ST-E3 which is radio), and because my other flash is infrared-only. If I were starting over, IΓÇÖd go radio, because in order to use infrared the ΓÇ£eyeΓÇ¥ on the slaves has to be able to see the infrared beam from the master. Maybe some day IΓÇÖll sell the 580EX II and the ST-E2 and move to a full radio frequency system.  I switch this flash from standalone mode to slave mode, depending on what IΓÇÖm doing. Fortunately itΓÇÖs easy to make that change.  Speedlite ST-E2 (bought January 2011)  I use this mainly to control the 580EX II and 600EX-RT flashes, but sometimes use it standalone if I want the autofocus assist light.  HINT: The 580 and 600 flashes work best with lithium AA batteries. You get a lot more flashes than with alkaline batteries. I keep eight of them in my camera bag. The ST-E2 uses a 2CR5 battery, and I keep one spare in my camera bag.  HINT: Both the 580 and 600 flashes have tripod mounting sockets on the side, hidden under rubber covers. Those are really handy! They also come with ΓÇ£feetΓÇ¥ with tripod sockets which are good for when you donΓÇÖt need to use a full tripod.",7/16/2015

Since this guy is a bit of a dinosaur now I was able to get one for a very reasonable price and try it out with little risk. I am happy to report that this transmitter works far better than I had been led to believe it would.<br /><br />On a recent wedding I was able to easily control a 580EX Speedlite in a Westcott Rapid Box Octa and make some very beautiful images of the cake, the brides shoes and the rings. Not having to jump up from camera position to adjust the power on the flash was nice and the TTL exposure was actually outstanding. I have previously used the 580EX as the master to control an off-camera 550EX but now I can use both speedlites off camera as I did for a multi-flash image of my daughter indoors and of a model outdoors in dappled sun. Though the outdoor performance was somewhat hit-or-miss I did get the majority of exposures with both flashes firing. I would still reach for Pocket Wizards for 100% hits but the ease of TTL exposure is worth giving this a try first on my shoots.<br /><br />If you already have one or more 430EX, 430EXll, 550EX, 580EX or 580EXll speedlites and you want to try using off-camera TTL on-the-cheap then I highly recommend picking-up one of these transmitters, provided you can find a nice one for around $100 or less as I did. As long as you have line-of-sight with your flash the system seems to work ok. Indoors is far more forgiving that out so be aware. The one complaint I have is that the mounting to the hotshoe is rather loose. I have confirmed that this is very normal but that is not really all that comforting. I have tried this on both of my Canons; a 5Dmkll and a 1DmkiV.",10/16/2014

It can be a bit tricky to use it in bright sunlight, since it can be overpowered by the sun so that flashes can't see its own flash for signaling, but I've always found it easy to compensate for this.  It has some handy features, such as lighting ratios for two different groups of flashes.<br /><br />Its biggest drawback is that it uses 2CR5 lithium batteries, which can be hard to find in stores.  I've taken to ordering several at a time, so I always have extras on-hand.  However, you can easily get over 1,000 shots out of a fresh battery, so at about $6 per battery, that's not too bad.<br /><br />Overall, it's a solid device that works well with several EX series Speedlites (check their specifications to see if they have a slave function) that I think is worth its price (I got mine used for about $150).",12/19/2014

Other reviewers have raised legitimate concerns about the handle putting strain on the main zipper compartment, since there is no attachment from the main handle to the body of the back to help distribute weight.  I can see the strain breaking down the material over time.  Also, I verified as one reviewer stated that Canon provides no product warranty with their bags.  Those misgivings aside, however, I like how my items fit comfortably in this bag.  It's small enough to be very portable, yet gives you enough space to fit quite a bit of equipment. While the overall dimensions are smaller, the space allotted for each lens is larger than say, the Tamrac 8, for example.  A quick aside on bag specs: it seems many manufacturers inflate the number of bodies and lenses that can be carried inside.  Perhaps they're all using 50mm primes and entry level dslr's to arrive at those numbers.  In this bag, I fit a pro dslr without a lens attached, a flash beneath it, 2 wide angle lenses (roughly 16-35mm), a standard prime, a nifty 50mm, and a second flash.  Another note on these bags: where do you put the filter hoods? I have mine resting on top of the dividers, but none of the bags I've seen allows the type of filters that go with wide angle lenses. I digress-- the side pockets work great for stashing batteries, stray cords, and filters.  It's been put through the paces only a couple of times, so continued use will give me more information about it's reliability and resistance to the elements.",2/19/2014

The long one is padded for comfort if you are traveling or carrying it for long periods of time. I would recommend this bag to anyone who is looking for a piece that is solid and will last awhile. Totally worth the money! Thanks again,11/6/2014

So that you can be confortable knowing your camera and other equipment inside are all protected. Also comes with two dividers that have an extra flap each. Again, brilliant padding in the dividers. The front pocket had enough room for my battery charger and couple more cables. The mesh pocket on the inside of the top cover will more than satisfy worth the ability to hold remotes, memory cards, and extra batteries as well!<br />This top quality bag let's you know it's ready for the long haul as soon as you lay your hands on it. Metal clips that rotate, big strong zippers, 2 durable rubber feet, and stitching you'd expect from wildly overpriced products. I'm looking forward to using this bag for years.<br />Be warned though, it isn't big enough to hold all your equipment, but it suits me just fine considering that I am just getting into photography and don't have too many extra lenses or tripods etc.",2/9/2015

In the large compartment I have managed to easily fit: 1 Rebel T5i body with neck strap, 1 EFS 18-55 lens, 1 EF 75-300 Telephoto lens, the T5i english language booklet, 1 folded micro fiber wipe, and my old PowerShot 100HS with its case. The zipper closes nice and easily and i am using the two dividers it came with to separate my T5i body from the lenses and another divider to separate the booklet from the lenses. In the front compartmemt i was able to store the T5i and PowerShot battery chargers and cords as well as the T5i USB cable and an extra SD memory card. The bag looks and feels high quality. No complaints here.",8/25/2014

Larson's review covers it very well, but I'll add my two cents. For the 25 bucks currently asked, this is one of the best values in a camera bag I have seen. The quality level is exceptional. Extremely well designed, top notch materials, all the right 'extras' and a lot more than you would expect at this price. High quality rubber/plastic feet, super nice straps (two), easy to fasten, durable, and well machined metal clasps, a great pocket with interior storage on the front, nice padded dividers inside, and a very compact, yet highly usable size.<br /><br />This is not big enough for a DSLR and 2 lenses, flash, and so on, this is more of a compact kit bag, think compact P&S or  a mirror-less compact system like the Samsung line (NX300, EX2F, NX1100/1000, etc.) or Olympus E-PM2, or Panasonic LX7 and similar. I'm using mine with the Samsung NX300 and the 18-55mm Zoom. There's just enough room for the camera and kit lens, maybe an extra pancake lens, charger, batteries, cards, and cables. If you want a light, compact kit to go, this is your bag!<br /><br />The bag is moisture resistant, has a nice pull-over top flap, great zippers with added &#34;tags&#34; to make them easy to find and grasp, very nice fabric, just an excellent bag in every way.<br /><br />Highly recommended!",2/4/2014

I not only put my Canon in it, but a full-sized pair of Nikon binoculars.<br />2. Well organized.  The interior pocket works well for extra batteries and SD cards, while I carried two different battery chargers in the exterior pocket.<br />3. Takes a beating.  I put the bag under my feet while on the airplane and it protected my camera and binoculars well.  It also got knocked around a lot as we moved across China, but everything inside was fine.<br />4. Convenient.  The handle on top and the strap give you two different options for carrying it.<br />5. Looks good.<br />6. The front clasp can be a little unweildy to use, but for most uses you probably don't even need to snap it as the zipper seems more than adequate to keep everything together.<br />Overall, a good product and does its job well.  I used to carry my Canon in my backpack when I traveled - like I said, I like to travel light - but this bag has made a believer out of me.

I noted the size and compared it to my previous case I've had for 30+ years. The stated size was close to my old case. Canon stated, even on the tag attached to the bag, that you can get two camera bodies and three or four lenses and a few other accessories. Let me correct that: I have a T5i and two lenses in the main section with dividers. There is no more room for anything. Interior padding takes up a lot of the dimensions. This is good, but Canon needs to be honest in what can fit. This bag is essentially the same size as the 10EG which has the side pouches for $56.00, not enough added features to justify the extra cost. But for one body and two lenses it's not bad. Quality is excellent. Size is convenient for hiking or long walks. The waist strap is one feature that I thought would be good, preventing the bag from flopping as you hike. The shoulder strap is not the most comfortable, but OK. For tall people the shoulder strap might be a little short. The padded section is sewn in place, not adjustable. For the price it's merits three stars.",3/7/2014

Now, read between the lines. It does not say 2 cameras and 4 lens. That hedge probably means 1 camera  and 4 lens or 2 cameras and 3 lens. Depends on size of cameras and lens, right! Here is what I got in it as a test. Not sure it is what I will carry as it is not easy to whip out to take a photo - more on what I really will carry in a moment. Depends if you are talking pure \\""storage\\"" or space to pull out a camera ready for action on an actual photo shoot.  It comes with two padded, moveable partitions held in place with velcro that have a flap on the top. I suppose they could be held in place vertically as I have done or horizontally.  I stored a Canon T2i body on the left side, a partition, then a Canon G1 Powershot, another partition, then a 55-250mm lens on the bottom, the partition flap over it, then the 18-55mm kit lens on top. The flap from the left partition lays over the G1 leaving top of the T2i exposed. A piece of bubble wrap could lay on top of the T2i. Then, I could set my lens shade and G1 lens extender on top of that, as well as the battery pack for the T2i. Now that is a bunch of stuff and ideal if I want to transport a lot of stuff on a trip. I can even put two battery chargers, one for each camera, plus a couple of extra batteries in the front pouch with room for several memory cards in the top inside cover. Now that gets me to where I am going, but not so convenient for popping out a camera for immediate action.<br /><br />My tests also say that you could put a T2i body on the left and get four lens sitting vertically, maybe horizontally, depending on size of course. Anything over my 55-250mm in length or width would be problematic in that scenario, but if not trying to cram that much in, something wider would fit. You could also sit the T2i, or another in that series upright with a longer lens attached and still have room to place at least one more on the right.<br /><br />On a shoot, I may carry my old backup G1 in my cargo pants. What I intend to carry on a shoot in this camera bag, most likely, is the T2i on the left with battery pack installed, facing up (LCD screen down) with kit lens installed, then one partition with the 55-250mm lens lying down on the right side. With the partition's flap down, the lens shade sits on top. When I want to take a normal photo, I just reach in and grab the camera. True, the lens shade just cannot fit  on the lens whether the lens is sitting vertical or horizontal in the bag unless perhaps you have it installed on the T2i and camera is upright, not vertical as I plan - have not tried that scenario. Perhaps the kit lens could still fit under it. To me that is the only flaw. I have to screw that on any time I need it. I will have a polarizing filter and UV filters installed also. Do not let anyone tell you the t2i battery pack will not fit in this bag while on or off the camera - not true. Snug, maybe, but do you want any of this flopping around? Not me! I have not given this a water test - may just give it a spray with some Scotch-Guard to be on the safe side as I will spend time with it in the outdoors and setting it on possibly damp ground. Sharp looking! Would not hesitate to buy it again!<br /><br />The bag appears very well made. The shoulder strap looks sturdy and well padded. I will get a chance to test it in an airport setting in a week and have a few days of intense photography over several days as all my gear is new. Exciting!<br />7/22/13 Update<br />I stand corrected about the lens hood. Just discovered I can put the hood on my Canon 50-250mm lens, place it hood down vertically in the bag and it will still close fine, snug, but close. Previously I had it hood UP. For some reason that was more awkward. Plus, now I can insert a second battery charger next to the lens, or I can add my 7\\"" Aputure Timer Remote Control. And, since I am still learning this camera, really a mini-computer, if you will, I can put the 3/8\\"" thick instruction book in the mesh sleeve inside the top flap and it still all closes. I am totally amazed with this bag. No need for a shoe horn to get stuff in or out, but I think I have room still for a shoe horn in the front pocket if needed.

Not a big deal, but I prefer bags with one buckle rather than two.<br /><br />Second, as several have mentioned, the bag appears smaller than I thought it would be.  I consider it to be the minimum size I could accept for my Canon 60D.  The main compartment barely holds my camera with the attached Canon EF 24-105 mm lens.  It's a tight fit at 7 1/2\\"" long, and this is with both Velcro partitions removed.  The camera width of 6\\"" is also maxed out. With the camera and lens installed there is little room in that compartment for anything else except the carrying strap.  I suppose I could stack small extras on top of the lens, but that would interfere with the removal of the camera from the bag.  Although my big Canon lens hood, model EW-83H, could rest on top of the lens, I'll probably leave it home unless I plan on using it constantly. Otherwise it would be a hindrance. Extra lenses?  Forget it!<br /><br />However I am able to carry a 77mm filter and a 60D Pocket Guide in the mesh pocket under the cover. I store a small Canon flash, model 270EX, in the front compartment. I am also able to squeeze a battery charger with the flash there together. My charger is the STK LP-E6 (optional) which is smaller than the 60D OEM Canon charger with its charging lights.  And a DC adaptable cable is included.  I wouldn't be able to install together the stock Canon charger with the flash there.<br /><br />In summary, this bag is the minimum size I would accept for my camera and accessories.  I have yet to decide whether to move up to a slightly larger bag or not.  In any event the quality and design of this bag are excellent.  It deserves 5 stars. If you carry only one lens which, when mounted to the camera, measures no more than 7 1/2\\""L x 6\\""W, and compactness is important to you, you should consider this bag.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />I've found another way to insert the camera and lens into the case thatmay be more convenient than the previously listed method (above).  Instead of inserting the camera into the case- bottom first, I put one side of the camera down first onto the case base.  By doing this the pressure of the 6\\"" wide camera pushing against the sides of the case is eliminated.  The width is now situated vertically instead of horizontally, resulting in less effort required to remove the camera from the case than previously.  There is even extra room to add a Velcro partition under and in front of the lens to protect it and help keep it level.",8/23/2013

The problem is it's really too small.  After much manipulating I am able to make it work for my two lenses, body and a few cords, but the access is difficult to work with.  This is my first time buying a gadget bag, during the past 36 years of using a 35 milimeter camera and a digital camera - in the past I have always had a more fitted case and thought this would be wonderful to have &#34;some&#34; day.  Well when I got my new digital camera and extra lens it seemed the perfect time.  I wish I had bought the one from Amazon that is their own brand and has a yellow inside with defined sections.  If I had seen this on the website at the time I made my purchase I would have.  In the Canon bag my lenses don't feel safe and I am concerned the body will get scratched in this bag.  I actually bought the micro fiber giotto bags to cover them, so now I have spent even more money on this bag and it still isn't right.  I should have just sent it back and tried another bag.  I also like the bag by case logic that has the two lens holders on the side, but when I got it somewhere else the sitching was coming out, so why spend $60.00 on it.",3/6/2014

It securely holds my Canon Rebel 2000, and has room for two lenses. The dividers in the main compartment are well padded, and they fold over, I suppose for extra padding, or for protection on top. The bag also has a zipper pouch in each of its front and top compartments, for holding little extras like film, wallet, etc. Being an amateur, film, my camera, and a lens or two is all I need to take pictures, a professional might desire a larger bag that can hold more items.<br />The bag is good looking, and has a nice solid construction, the material feels as if it will hold up to years of use. The details in this bag really impressed me. It has two plastic feet on the bottom for added stability, the clips and rings are all made of black metal, rather than plastic, it has a nicely hidden strap to convert it into a waist pack (though I find it a bit bulky to wear that way), the bottom padding is removable and is hard sided for extra protection.

Bought it on Amazon for about half of what my local Target charges. Sorry, Target. The bag is great, perfect size. I used it on a trip to Disney World. Held my camera body with a lens attached and two extra lenses as well. For reference, I have a Canon T1i Rebel and use a 50mm EF lens, a 10-22mm EF-S lens, and the 55-250mm EF-S lens. Two removable, Velcro dividers make organizing the lenses and camera body easy. I also managed to squeeze my sunglasses into the bag when absolutely necessary.<br /><br />A mesh zipper pouch inside the top cover of the bag held papers and tickets I needed to keep organized for the park, while the smaller mesh pouch inside the front pouch held things I didn't want to lose, like SD cards, with a couple little holders and extra space inside the front pouch for a lens pen, some lip balm and other essentials.<br /><br />This bag is VERY solidly constructed, and you can keep it securely closed using the front clasp only, for ease of access, or for extra security use the full zipper beneath that. All clasps, buckles are solid metal. No flimsy plastic or cheap pieces anywhere on the bag. Main zipper is heavy duty nylon. Shoulder strap and pad are very comfortable. My only gripe would be that it could be a little longer, as it's too short to wear across your body. However the bag also has a built in belt that stays stowed in a buttoned back cover that you could use, though with a DSLR and one or two extra lenses, it can get a little heavy. You could always swap out a shoulder strap more to your liking if that's an issue, as it is fully removable from the bag.",11/18/2014

But if you're new to the DSLR world and don't have a lot of accessories (like me), or you're looking for an on-the-go case that fits a couple of necessities instead of your whole collection, you can't go wrong with this bag.

It's small enough to comfortably carry it in a shirt or coat pocket. I power it with four AA lithiums to keep weight as low as possible. Despite its small size, the recycling time is amazingly fast, 0.1 to 4.5 seconds with alkaline AA batteries or 0.1 to 2.5 seconds with rechargeable batteries. That's faster than both the 420EX and the 550EX!<br /><br />The shoe lock of the 220EX is fast and simple to use. Once mounted, you simply flip a small latch to lock it. Much more convenient than the thumbwheel found on some Speedlites.<br /><br />Although compact, the 220EX is surprisingly powerful and full featured: GN 72.6 feet (22m) at ISO 100, 28mm full frame coverage (17 or 18mm APS-C), near-infrared AF assist light, flash exposure confirmation light, E-TTL, TTL, second-curtain sync, FE Lock (flash exposure lock), flash exposure compensation and FP Flash (high speed sync). You won't notice most of these features as the control panel is nearly barren: on-off switch, ready light, FP Flash switch and flash exposure confirmation light. FE Lock, flash exposure compensation and second-curtain sync are controlled from the camera. To access all flash features you need a camera with a flash menu, e.g., Elan 7 series, 3, 1V and most EOS DSLRs.<br /><br />The 220EX was discontinued in 2009, so does it work with newer cameras? Yes, it works fine with any EOS using E-TTL flash metering, e.g., , all EOS DSLRs. I used the 220EX on a 5D, 5D MKII, 6D, 7D, 40D, 50D and 60D and it performed like a champ.<br /><br />Where the 220EX falls down slightly is compatibility with flash menus of newer EOS. With the 6D, the menu can set FEC, second curtain sync, toggle between E-TTL II and Averaging, set sync speed in Av mode and disable flash firing (with AF assist enabled). Flash bracketing, manual power and custom functions are grayed out. High speed sync (FP Flash) can only be set on the flash itself. The 60D, 7D and 5D MKII are the same as the 6D except sync speed can't be set in Av mode.<br /><br />Focusing in the dark is quick and discreet thanks to the near-infrared AF assist light. The AF assist light has a range of about 16 feet (5m). With the 220EX mounted, low light AF is vastly improved. Unfortunately, the AF assist light of the 220EX only covers the center AF area. It affords no slide sensor coverage for multiple AF arrays such as the 5D MK II or 7D. However, the top, center and bottom sensors are covered by the AF assist beam. With 45-sensor arrays--e.g., EOS 1V or 3--it only seems to work with the center AF sensor. Nevertheless, I find the near-infrared AF assist light a welcome feature and greatly preferable over the disco strobe AF assist of the 270EX.<br /><br />This Japan made flash was discontinued in 2009 and replaced by the 270EX. Why buy a 220EX when you can get a newer design like the 270EX for $150? For most buyers it's all about the near-infrared AF assist and/or a bargain price of old stock or used. In my experience of dropping a lot of Speedlites, the single piece design is stronger than two piece units. However such strength means no swivel and tilt so look elsewhere if you need these features. Of course, you could use an off-shoe cord and use your hand or a bracket for bounce functions.<br /><br />I bought my 220EX in 1999 for $125 and, nearly 15 years later, it's still going strong. If you need a basic compact flash with E-TTL features, the 220EX is a great choice. It is a perfect travel companion due to its petite size. I refuse to let go of mine because it's the smallest E-TTL Speedlite available with near-infrared AF assist. The 220EX is a wonderful blend of simplicity and power in a petite package that fits in your pocket.KII are the same as the 6D except sync speed can't be set in Av mode.<br /><br />Focusing in the dark is quick and discreet thanks to the near-infrared AF assist light.

Since this remote was not indicated as being compatible with the 6D (NOT 60D), either on Amazon or on Canon's own website, I put it away in the closet.  Recently, however, an acquaintance who has this same remote said that it works with more Canon cameras than what is indicated, and he showed me that his worked with my 6D (from some 18-20 ft. away).  So, I got mine back out and tried it -- it works great.  And, unlike the RC-6 recommended  for the 6D, it will also work for instantaneous shots and not just timer-release shots (however, the camera is DOES have to be set on timer-release -- even when instantaneously shooting).  This RC-1 remote has a 3-position switch: &#34;Lock,&#34; &#34;Immediate Shutter Release,&#34; and &#34;Timer-Delay Shutter Release&#34; (although they are not labeled as such on the device -- it's in the instructions).  I just wanted to let others know that this remote does in fact work with the Canon 6d (and probably some other Canon camera models, too).",6/12/2015

This remote allows me to snap photos once I have settings setup knowing camera is stable. Its stable because after Ive touched it I wait a few seconds in-case my hand vibrations shook camera. My only complaint was the cable is to short. So I cut the cable and extended it myself Its now 20 feet long and perfect.,1/6/2015

It's used in situations when pressing the camera's shutter button may induce image blurring vibration, e.g., macro or long exposures. Typically a cable release is used with the camera mounted on a steady tripod.<br /><br />The RS60-E3 works with any EOS with a mini phone plug socket: Rebel series, Elan series, IXE, 60D and 70D. It is not compatible with Canon's pro bodies, e.g., 1D, 5D or 7D series cameras. These models require a \\""N\\"" series locking remote, e.g., RS-80N3.<br /><br />It's easy to use. First, slide the cable jack into the mini plug socket (under the side rubber boot). Operation is exactly like the normal shutter button: half depress locks AF and metering and full depress fires the shutter. It has a lock position for self-timed bulb exposures. The cable is 2 feet long but may be lengthened with an optional extension cable.<br /><br />When I consider the light duty build, the RS60-E3 seems a little pricy at $20. However, mine has held up well for 10 years, yielding thousands of sharp images. As long as you're not rough on your gear, it should last a long time.",10/10/2014

I like to stick with the same brands to ensure the quality of production and the RS60 E3 delivers. It provides the same function as a shutter release cables that are used for film slr's--except in this case, it is called a remote switch.<br /><br />I purchased this item mainly for night photography to prevent camera shake when mounted on a tripod. Basically, this is just an external extension of your shutter button except you can lock the shutter release for things like BULB photography. However, you could use it for other things like self-portraits although the cord is relatively short. With this remote, you could shoot in continuous burst mode, timer, single shot, or whatever shooting functions your Canon provides.<br /><br />Some of you may be wondering why I purchased this over the wireless remote and the reason is just to be safe. The remote switch sends an infrared signal to the camera's metering sensor to let the camera know when the shutter button is pressed. So for the most part, you'd have to point the wireless remote in front of the camera for it to function, which leads me to long exposures... It is advised to avoid extensive exposure to infrared as this might damage a camera's sensor especially when shooting with slow shutter speeds.<br /><br />So why 4 starts and not 5? The pricing. I would have liked to purchase this for a cheaper price but as with all Canon products, they are marked up--but with good reason, might I add. Sure, you can settle for a cheaper remote for the same function, but I just like knowing that my gear is made by a company I can trust.",9/15/2013

I wanted this in order to prevent any camera shake (and the resulting blurry image), without having to resort to using a timer on the camera itself. The remote does exactly what you would expect, it triggers the shutter on the camera, and since it doesn't require batteries, is always ready to be put to work without any fuss. It works really well and overall, am very happy I purchased it.<br /><br />The cable is very short, which isn't much of an issue when you're standing right at the camera, but if you want to move away from the camera at all, then the short cable becomes more of a liability. This is easily (and cheaply) remedied by purchasing a 2.5mm headphone extension cable. I went with the [[ASIN:B000Z0YECU Your Cable Store 12 Foot 2.5mm Stereo Headphone Extension Cable]] (available here on Amazon for under $7 at the time of this writing), which now gives me a combined cable length of 14 feet. That said, the short length of the cable is the primary reason for me knocking off a star. Other than the short cable, this is a good, quality remote shutter switch for supported Canon cameras, including the Powershot SX50 HS, and I have no problem recommending it to anyone who has a supported camera (though I would recommend picking up an extension cable at the same time, just to make your life easier.)",1/16/2014

That's fine, if your subject is in the middle of your shot... but I found myself constantly moving the focus point, and standing next to the camera to take a photo. Having the aperture wide open made this very necessary.<br /><br />Other than that, this product does what it says: press lightly to focus, press firmly to snap a shot, hold and slide the button to keep the shutter open.",11/4/2013

This simple remote works great - just started using it for a Canon 70D. Switch can be depressed halfway for focusing and all the way for shutter. Also has a lock function to help with long exposures.    Note alternatives also available for the 70D (and most other Canon DSLRs) - the Canon RC-6 wireless remote which allows immediate or 2 second delay shutter modes http://smile.amazon.com/Canon-RC-6-Wireless-Controller-Digital/dp/B0037NX6JY/ and the AmazonBasics remote http://smile.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Wireless-Remote-Control-Canon/dp/B00BCEJ0E0/ which only allows 2 second delay shots. I have the AmazonBasics remote but wish I had bought the Canon RC-6 instead as I would like to have the immediate shutter option.    The wired remote is handy when you are trying to carefully control the shot and shutter and using LiveView - no need to reach around the front of the camera to activate the shutter with the wireless remote. But the wire attached means there might be a slight vibration if you aren't careful with the cable. I like having both a wired and wireless remote to give me options and they are small and lightweight so can be easily carried anywhere.    One quick tip - the tiny manual that comes with the remote doesn't explain the hole in the bottom but I found an older copy online - you can wind the cable around the remote and plug it into the bottom (and the notches on the side help to hold the cable), which helps with packing.",11/30/2014

Recently I came online to replace the 1 GB card in my Sony and decided to also check out how much I could find the old 64 mb card for. In my search I also found this camera like new, used from a dealer on Amazon and it had the 64 MB Card in it for less than the card  64 Card by itself cost so I bought the Camera and got the card free for less the cost of the card. This is I think around a 2.3 Mg pixel cameral and the quality of the shots is great even for enlargements of 18x24 size from the HQ shots. The pictures are true to life and better than my Sony . One card holds over 100 High Quality shots and it also does low 640x400 quick time movies.

I didn't honestly expect to find the Adventure 2, so I was delighted to find it for sale. And since I've had mine for over a decade, I figure I'm qualified to review it, right?<br /><br />For its size, this backpack holds a surprising amount of stuff. Mine currently holds a film SLR body with short lens attached, a telezoom, plus an Argus rangefinder in the padded compartments, an in the other various pockets and compartments I have two flash units, about 14 filters, various cables, extra caps, and various other bits, and there's still plenty of room. It also has tripod straps.<br /><br />The only real downside, for me, is that it can get very bottom heavy due to the design. This is especially true in my case, as my film gear weighs a ton more than my digital gear (there's a reason they call the Argus &#34;The Brick&#34;). That's why I'm considering swapping my gear around and putting my main DSLR in this bag and retiring the film gear to one of my less-useful packs.<br /><br />Though I haven't used it much in the last few years, it got a lot of use before that, and it has held up beautifully. All of the straps and zippers are still in perfect condition, and all of the seams are holding tight. Too bad you can no longer find them in other colors. Mine is purple.",5/30/2014

I like the compartments.  It appears well made.  In general, I like it.  However, the bag is approximately the size of two regular sized shoe boxes, or, the size of a kindergartners backpack.  You cannot put your camera in the bag with the battery pack/grip attached.  You will need two compartments for the them.  You cannot put a camera in with 300mm lens AND hood, without modifications.  Each adjustment results in the loss of a compartment.<br /><br />I consider the means to attach a tripod, in a word, \\""laughable\\"".  Perhaps a \\""compact\\"" tripod.  In fact, I feel I can assure you will have a backache by the end of the day if you attach a tripod as shown.  Don't expect the water bottle/lens attachments, they aren't there.<br /><br />In truth, I have a butt pack with 2 water bottle sleeves that is more than adequate if one didn't wish to store the camera.  But wait, its a \\""camera\\"" bag.  How puzzling.<br /><br />I'll give it to you straight.  I have a DSLR with attached 55-250mm, two standard lenses, an external flash, filters, three batteries and a few assorted items.  This bag will NOT suffice for all.  If I leave out the camera, from the \\""camera\\"" bag, it would carry all my equipment.  So bear in mind, this is not the case you want if you are more than a strict amateur.<br /><br />On the plus side, if you want a bag that DOESN'T say \\""photographer\\"", and you don't plan to ever add anything to your gear, then this might be for you.",8/28/2013

I bought this bag about ten years ago and I still swear by it. I will agree with most of the other users in that it's small and cumbersome to a point.  You have to think open about this though. It makes you think what you really need therefore eliminating clutter and making hiking much more manageable.  Also it's great for metropolitan work in that it looks like a regular bag.

My old camera bag, which I purchased back in the late 80's was a Tamrac, and I carried it through many airports, up and down the mountain trails in Colorado and it always protected my gear. It's been showing some signs of wear, and I chose this Tamrac bag as it's replacement (judged by the photo and dimensions). While I haven't moved all my stuff into it completely I just wanted to let you know that I didn't have any problems put my Panasonic GH3, and G5KK camera bodies in it along with the following lenses (all Panasonic Lumix): 25mm, 100-300mm, 45-200mm, 7-14mm, and a 45-150mm in the main compartment. I see no reason I won't be able to put various accessories in it either, and just in time for a field trip. This was well worth the price paid!",4/30/2014

The way it's designed it also distributes the weight nicely although I would not want to carry it further than from the car to a venue. That is unless carrying around a bowling ball all day is something you do for fun. So it more than handle my needs, and it's a real quality build. I can't recommend it highly enough.",12/2/2014

I should have probably considered the super pro 12.  It does look like it would be easy to carry using the handle or the carrying strap.

You have the ability to store many things and it easily customized to accommodate a diverse array of lens/camera body collections. This is an undeniable fact but is it a so-called \\""pro\\"" bag? I sure doesn't seem like it to me.<br /><br />First of all, It simply isn't convenient and in the field can be frustratingly difficult to get gear out in a hurry. For instance, the shoulder straps interfere when you try to remove the locks that allow the top flap to be opened. Using only the front straps seem like it would be a good option but not if you have any weight in the bag.<br /><br />While the bag is probably great for DX bodies and kit lenses, if fails when it comes to the larger FX bodies and professional level lenses. I use a D800 and a D800E for my work and I require my 14-24mm f/2.8G, 24-70mm f/2.8G and a combination of either 28mm f/1.8G , 50mm f/1.8G or 85 f/1/.8G or 105mm f/2.8G micro, and unfortunately I cannot fit my entire combo in the bag at the same time. I work around this by keeping one of the bodies and lens out of the bag and only use the bag for lens changes and for other gear items. Not perfect but a workable situation, for sure<br /><br />Even though the bag does not hold nearly as much gear as I hoped nor does it allow the ease of access I had hoped it would, it does a good job of keeping a huge amount of non-lens/camera items well organized and are all somewhat easily accessed.<br /><br />If I wasn't so busy and really needed a bag for my work, I probably would have sent this back and tried another option. However, the time has passed and I'm trying to figure out a work around that will allow me to get the most out of this bag.",4/13/2014

I got the 5613 Ultra Pro first. That' s a good, bigger bag. I can have almost all my things in there, but it is too big for me to carry it around as a shoulder bag. Then, I got 5608. That's way too small and the description isn't accurate for its size. This one, 5612, is a good balance for me. It is not as big as some claim. Smaller than this one would be difficult to have a full-frame DSLR and a few lenses there. Even at the 5612 size, I cannot have all my lenses there. With two cameras, it is inadequate. But, this is a compromise shoulder bag. I'll keep it. The downside for improvement is organization of the compartments. With long or wide lenses, one has to reorganize the spaces because most are too small for lenses with hood on. If you switch lenses often and don't want to take the hood on/off often, there is  a good chance you won't like the way the compartments are divided. The two layers room arrangement is inconvenient but I'm not certain there is a better alternative for a  shoulder bag. Well, I may have to keep the 5613 as well because that one gives you much easier access of things quickly. But, it is just too big as a shoulder bag to carry around for long.

The inserts are easily movable, and the bridge for the camera is a very nice feature.  The pockets in the lid and front are roomy, and the side pockets easily fit my filter wallets.  The only downside for me was the top flap.  Yes, there is a inner pocket that causes this to be thick, but the lid isn't designed for easy entry.  It is thick, bulky, and (as seen in the picture) covers much of the front of the bag.  In order to gain entry into the bag you have to lift this heavy flap up and hold it out of the way while you pull out your camera... a move that is not feasible if you are wearing the bag at the time.  Sometimes those great shots come along that have you wanting to whip out your camera, not have to stop, put the bag on the ground and fiddle with the lid until you can get to your camera.  As a travel bag though it would be great, its just not what I'd use in the field.  Otherwise, spot on.... I'd just prefer a zipper along the top that would allow for a faster grab of my camera when needed.",5/9/2014

It was canvas, with sewn in dividers and it was perfect for my F3AS and 3 lenses.  It lasted 10 years or so and I replaced it with a similar bag in black and it too lasted about 10 years.  Finally, with the clips rusting and the corners fraying, I had to replace them.  However, the prices had greatly increased.  So I repurposed an old backpack and made due while I researched options.  I had this bag on my wish list and when the price dropped by about 45%, I ordered it.<br /><br />I keep a lot in this bag: 1 Nikon D7000 body, two zooms and one 35mm fixed focal length, an SB700 flash, an SB200 flash, set of filters, hoods and caps, a cleaning kit, spare batteries, and a Fujifilm X10 camera.  There is room for all of that and the it's still comfortable and secure to carry.<br /><br />One feature I really like is the Velcro patch near the bottom center clip.  How many times have you picked up your bag by the strap and watched your gear tumble out because the top wasn't secured?  The Velcro helps hold the cover on and while it won't prevent a spill, it limits it.  There are a total of three clips to secure the cover, so it will put up with a lost of jostling about and will prevent opportunistic grab and run theft.<br /><br />Very happy with this bag and I would recommend it.",5/1/2014

It is a mid-sized bag, designed to carry up to two camera bodies. The crucial issue with this type of bag, is whether it has adequate space to carry exactly what you need, including lenses and larger accessories like flash units and battery packs. Check Tamrac's website, and look at the diagrams showing the interior compartments of the bag, and how components may be stored, and judge if there's enough space for the particular gear you have.<br />The interior of the bag can be divided into up to six smaller compartments. The layout is designed to accept a body with a zoom lens up to around 8 inches in length attached. While a camera with a long lens will fit in the bag, you'll have arrange things carefully if you want to carry too much else. Also this setup does not work well if you have a battery grip attached. One solution is to store the camera and grip with no lens attached. Doing this, there is more than adequate space for the body, and three or four lens, and a flash unit. Stored vertically, a long lens can be accommodated with no problem. Carrying your gear this way, you're not immediately prepared to shoot, as you must take a few moments to assemble the camera.<br /><br />Though the bag is really better suited to accommodating the gear to fully outfit one camera. In a pinch, the 5606 can accommodate two camera bodies, even with battery packs, but that will leave just about a third of the available space for lenses and a flash.<br /><br />There is a zippered fold down compartment with pockets in the front. It would be nice if the pockets had some kind of fasteners. Pouches with velco fasteners are on the side of the bag. Velcro is an extremely poor design choice. One should not risk putting valuable or heavy items into these pouches. They could easily be lost, or fall out and be broken, should the fasteners fail to hold. This wasted storage space is the bag's major flaw. Some type of modification would be required to make them truly useful.<br /><br />The 5606 has an excellent heavy duty carrying strap, and also has straps at the base for carrying a tripod. A semi useful feature is a wallet for carrying digital media and other small accessories. The wallet is attached to the bag with an elastic strip, and sides into a compartment on the side of the bag. The padding in bottom and sides could stand to be a bit thicker, but that can be said of most bags.<br /><br />As with any camera bag, it's ultimate usefulness depends on the user, and the particular gear to be carried. The 5606 isn't quite perfect in all situations, but it is adaptable enough to be useful most of the time. Available in several colors. Read more ΓÇ║ted storage space is the bag's major flaw.

At 100mm, it is long enough that you can get great bokeh or a soft focus look at f/2.8 (remember, shorter focal length macro lenses will not give you as short of a depth of focus), but not so long to make it bulky to carry through, say, a forest as you're looking for shots. I've used it for shoulders-up portraits to great effect, and of course for macro photos.

I also have a 24-105mm f4 kit lens and can say that duplication of the focal length was a little concerning... however... as far as shooting macro, you just can't get the same results with the tele-zoom... the 100mm macro gives razor-sharp results.  Works great for portraits too if you're a casual portrait shooter.<br /><br />If you're worried about the IS on the &#34;L&#34; version being lacking on this lens... consider that you're likely shooting bugs and flowers etc and that outdoor lighting is pretty strong... you'll have pretty quick shutter speeds.  It seems sharpest at about f8 or so (like many lenses).  If you shoot dimly lit stuff - get a ring light.  A cheap one is probably fine unless you're doing product photography or something like that, in which case, you're probably getting paid and can spend the extra $$ for a pro-quality ring flash.<br /><br />Just my 2 cents.  I think it's a great lens and a great addition to a kit if you already have a good long zoom, a good mid/wide zoom and a wide open prime like a 50 f1.8 or f1.4 or the 40mm pancake, which is another bargain lens that you can't really go wrong buying.",2/10/2014

After doing extensive research looking for the perfect macro lens, I boiled it down to two lenses - this, and the Canon 100mm f/2.8L: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NEGTSI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002NEGTSI&linkCode=as2&tag=allofthetech-20&linkId=53ETP2WETYNITTXY<br /><br />Let's talk about the differences - both of these lenses are amazing, so it comes down to what's most important to you.<br /><br />The non-L lens is fantastic. I had previously been using a $100 Sigma &#34;macro&#34; lens: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ALLMI8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000ALLMI8&linkCode=as2&tag=allofthetech-20&linkId=IDRD7EREYJNRT3C5<br /><br />After switching, my product photography went from aggressively mediocre to top-tier. This lens enables you to get extremely close to your subject, perfect for product photography. It is very sharp, and the wide aperture gives you a tremendous range of depth of field.<br /><br />For $550, this is an excellent lens to buy.<br /><br />But there's another option. The &#34;L&#34; version of this lens, for $900 after rebates. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NEGTSI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002NEGTSI&linkCode=as2&tag=allofthetech-20&linkId=53ETP2WETYNITTXY<br /><br />The L version of this lens is UNBELIEVABLY sharp. It is the sharpest lens I've ever tried, so sharp that my Canon 6D's 20MP sensor can't render all of the detail from the lens. If you're looking for the best macro lens that you can buy, one that you won't kind of regret in a few years when you get a 50MP camera, you cannot go wrong with the L version.<br /><br />So there you have it. If money is an issue but you still want great photos, get this lens. If you want to make an investment in the best macro lens on the market, get the L version. It's not always the case with the L version, but in this case the L version is definitely worth the money if you can afford it.<br /><br />Hope you found this helpful,<br /><br />Toddn.

Considering performance, decent build quality, and price, I'd consider it the best value of any Canon lens out there.  It's not an L lens and the 100mm L Macro version is more rugged, weather-sealed, and offers IS.  However, rest assured that optical performance is on the same level and if you can't take good macro shots with this one, then the L version will not do you much good either.  Also, IS is not very effective at a macro level.  I take a lot of shots of bugs in flight, which works best handheld with auto-focus, and this lens provides impressive results.

It's also one of the most versatile, since it's a true macro lens which does double- and even triple-duty as an incredible portrait lens and fast medium telephoto.<br /><br />The L version of this, which costs twice as much, really only brings optical image stabilization to the table, but its overall sharpness is, in practice, no better than this &#34;regular&#34; lens.  Also, lens flare is so well controlled by this lens' design that you can save your money on a lens hood. It has a second diaphragm in it that makes it nearly impossible to get flare without actually trying to, in which case you might be disappointed, since it really is hard to get flare even intentionally.  This is an impressive feat of engineering on Canon's part.<br /><br />It's also very fast to focus when the limiter switch is set to keep it out of the macro range.  But, even when the limiter is turned off, it doesn't tend to hunt for focus except in low light or at extremely close distances.  For low light, turn the focus limiter on, and you should have no problems.  And, if you're shooting macro, it's best to manually focus for that, anyway.<br /><br />And, again, I can't rave enough about how sharp this lens is.  From edge to edge, details are tack sharp, and there's very little chromatic aberration.  In fact, I don't think I've ever used another lens that had such well-controlled color fringing, even wide open at f/2.8.<br /><br />Vignetting, though noticeable when the aperture is left wide-open, isn't as bad as other lenses, such as the 85mm f/1.8 (considerably more noticeable, but actually rather nice for portraits, which is what that lens is geared toward).<br /><br />On a full-frame sensor (or on 35mm film), it can give 1-to-1 reproduction, which means objects you shoot at its closest focusing distance will be the same size on the sensor that they are in real life.  Imagine how much detail you could get in a print of a penny if its recorded image on film were the same size as the penny itself.  That's how macro lenses capture so much detail in small objects that our naked eye wouldn't be able to see.<br /><br />On APS-C sensor cameras, such as Rebels, the 60D, 70D, etc., it gives an effective reproduction of 2-to-1 (that is, 2x magnification), since APS-C sensors are only about half the size of full-frame.  So, if you have a full-frame sensor and an APS-C sensor that both have the same resolution, you will have to crop the image from the APS-C sensor less than an image from a full-frame sensor to get the same overall apparent magnification.  This will result in more detail in the APS-C sensor's image.  I got a Rebel to use specifically for macro work for this very reason, saving my 5D for portraiture and landscapes.<br /><br />Finally, this lens' build is just plain solid.  It feels sturdy, even with its plastic (though it's high-quality plastic) barrel.  It never ceases to feel great in your hand, no matter how many times you pick it up.<br /><br />I now find myself going back to my opening statement.  This lens is incredible.  Arguably one of the best all-around lenses ever created (and you'd be hard-pressed to argue that it's not).  I never get bored with it, especially since macro photography opens up a whole new world.  You'll be amazed at how exciting and interesting your back yard can be when you go on a safari in it with this lens.

I was hoping for a nice macro and a decent long portrait lens. I've discovered this is more than I had hoped for and something altogether different. This is a beautiful portrait lens and a very decent macro.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- long focal length (160mm equivalent on crop body)<br />- wide aperture<br />- beautiful bokeh<br />- lovely build quality<br />- fast, silent, very accurate focusing<br />- amazing IQ<br />- no distortion As Far As I Can Tell<br />- little or no chromatic aberration<br />- very sharp throughout<br />- oh, and it also does lovely Macro<br /><br />Cons:<br />- no IS<br /><br />Seriously, that's pretty much the only con I can really attribute.<br /><br />If you consider purchasing this lens consider that it has no IS which can limit it's hand held use to brighter situations, longer exposures or high ISO. Also note that the Macro functions wide open will have an extremely shallow depth of field. I find that stopping down to around f/8 makes this lens much easier to use, and produces just beautiful, perfectly sharp pictures.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />If you're looking for a very fast, long lens with great image quality with the great addition of Macro, then this is the lens foe you.<br /><br />I've used this lens for some great macro shots, even hand held. But my favorite use is portraits. I got to shoot some concerts from close to the stage with this lens (some wide open) and this lens performed above and beyond what I had hoped for. Focus was on the money for 98% of shots ( I don't want to risk saying all of them). Sharpness was stunning even wide open.

I purchased it after hours wading through reviews and comparisons, and mistakenly thought it would work for macro shots. Don't make the same mistake! This requires a significantly further focusing distance than macro or typical kit lenses. Due to my mistake, it sat unused for a while until I took it to a comic convention where I discovered that it's pretty much perfect for taking panel photos. The wide zoom range allowed me to get a good variety of shots from less than stellar seats, and when I did have decent seats the shots turned out gorgeous, even on a lower end Canon T3i body. This lens has become my go-to for covering similar events, and I'm looking forward to seeing what other uses I can get out of it.<br /><br />Why I took off a star: In lower light settings I found image blur to be an occasional issue with animated subjects. More manual controls (I was primarily using full auto) would likely compensate. And as other reviewers mentioned, images aren't as crisp at 300mm as they are at 100mm. The effect isn't drastic, though, and if you're going to be resizing down anyways it's not a deal-breaker.",7/10/2015

The c-2100uz takes excellent photos in low light and night time with out the flash.  The flash on the c-2100uz works great, lots of light produced.  The c-2100uz used batteries up fast.

Hooking up the c-2100uz directly to the computer only works in windows XP and with the official olympus c-2100uz software.  You don't want to try hooking up the camera directly to the computer to get the photos as it will break the camera if the batteries run out while hooked up.  The c-2100uz is only 2mp.  But the photos look great on my 1080p monitor.  The c-2100uz does not take good moving action shots, as the photos are most often blurry from motion.  The c-2100uz takes excellent macro shots.

At either extreme of zoom there is definite ghosting/shadowing and loss of focus, but this isn't the lens' fault, this type of artifacting is common among large zoom ranges.

But this would be used only in a recreational context and not as pro solution or even a pro am.  Also it might be good for beginners to use as a single lens and decide what subject matter they might want to focus on.  The 7x magnification gives a wide variety of use, but lacks either the very wide lens one might want for truly majestic landscapes, or the extreme zoom for long distance wildlife.<br />I am sure that USM is vital in some situations, but I have yet to come across a situation where it has made any difference.

I've taken around 200 photos in the past two days, with impressive results. Its alright that its from 2000 (or is it 1999?), and only 2.4 MP, it still takes great photos.<br /><br />Solid construction, everything functioning great after 14 years. If there is a downside, its the memory and battery life. HOWEVER its not a deal breaker. I can't afford a Leica for $900 at the moment, so this is a fine choice for me. I will say about the memory: I have a 64mb card and I shoot all my pics in 2400x1800 and FINE quality, so I get 36 photos. Not a big deal. Go for a walk, take 36 photos, and import the files to computer. The battery: I use Apple NiMh rechargeable batteries, using the eye viewfinder and limit the lcd display use I got through two days use. Using the camera maybe for around 3 hours.<br /><br />They are cheaper on Ebay, just fyi. But I'm very happy to have this first Leica. Next I will save up to buy a Leica M8!",9/11/2013

I have film that expired in January and February 2009 - which has always been stored at room-temperature - that still produces respectable images (albeit with strong red/yellow hues, very low contrast and occasional spots where developer goo has dried-up and didn't spread completely); though at this point anything expiring before then is no longer worth the risk, especially for the premium. At thrift stores I won't even pay more than $5 for a pack of 2009-expiration film anymore; what I have was gifted to me from an insurance agent earlier this year, and I don't plans to buy any more.    On top of problems with the film itself, the battery life for each pack is growing increasingly questionable. If you have any cameras equipped with motor-driven sonar autofocusing (SX-70 Sonar OneStep, Pronto Sonar OneStep, SLR-680, 690, etc.) then don't even bother as they absolutely require a minimum of 6v to function - especially the folding SLR-type cameras. To use expired 600 in my SLR-680, I've had to transfer the film (in the dark) to used, empty Impossible packs with a good battery before shooting it because the camera will otherwise seize-up half way through the pack. I've had very good luck using it in my Sun660, though.    If you are looking to shoot instant with your vintage Polaroid cameras, and get satisfying results (if you do it right): you will want to look to The Impossible Project's fresh-produced films, which come in variants for not just 600-type cameras, but Spectra and SX-70 as well. Yes it's expensive (sign up for their newsletter and watch for sales), yes you lose two shots (Polaroid's 10 vs TIP's 8), yes you need to use your brain to shoot it, and yes it's slow developing (for now), but the quality has improved to the point whereit walks all over expired Polaroid stock; and in the long-run is still cheaper than buying expired junk from scalpers.",12/14/2014

Works great on my Pentax K-r and K-01 cameras.  I also have a Vivitar ND 0.9 in the same size.  I haven't had any major problems with the Vivitar either, but it does sometimes throw off the camera's white-balance, making images look purple.  Not a big deal, as the purple cast can be removed easily in post-processing, but for a few dollars more, this Tiffen filter avoids the white-balance issue altogether.  It is well made, and even with a lot of pixel-peeping, I can't discern any degradation in picture quality.  I can even stack both filters (this one and the Viv) for an even stronger effect.  Even with both filters stacked, you won't get nice blurry water at the beach on a sunny day.  There's just too much light.  But at dusk on the beach you can get some great shots.  For waterfalls, if you are under the canopy of trees you might get nice blurred water in the daytime, especially if it's an overcast day.

However, it is clear that a nicer CPL filter would exist in the world. I took some difficult photos of snowy mountains (Idaho sawtooths) yesterday and had a tough time aligning the dark polarizer onto the blue sky behind the mountains (see photo). However, when taking pictures of rivers/creeks the polarizer cuts through the whitewater and allows you to see the river rocks (see my before/after photos). Also, the green foliage beside the river 'pops' with the filter. Unfortunately, at time, the polarizer gives the photos an artificial look (as opposed to a more natural look).

The perforations on the item are already torn and the adhesive use to keep the label on and perforations in place is covered in dust and grime. Upon opening the case, there is a layer of dust and grime on the inside case and on the lens. The only explanation I can think of was someone opened the item in the warehouse and left it open to accumulate this much dust and grime. I attempted to clean the lens with some lens cleaning tissues but what came off looked like if I tried to clean the bottom of my oil pan on my car. Dirt and grime. The condition of this \\""New\\"" lens was unacceptable.    The other items I received with this order were perfectly fine. The other lens cover and lens all were new and no damage.",3/26/2014

Appears to be good quality with no blemishes. Be careful when screwing the filter on and off as aluminum threads on the polarizer when mating with the aluminum threads of the lens body tend to occasionally gall up if not careful. This is typical and problematic of aluminum on aluminum threads. Aluminum is soft and gums up easily especially with mating screw threads. There's no need to tighten this thing anymore than slightly snug. Be careful not to cross thread. Take your time and don't force it.,8/19/2015

It does a fantastic job of giving the sky that beautiful blue color and making it stand out from the clouds. I used this for my brother's graduation and it was a bright sunny day and this polarizer helped me get the beautiful shots I wanted. This also comes quite in handy if you want to shoot with a wide aperture on a bright sunny day, because it automatically lowers the amount of light reaching your camera by a few stops. So basically you can bring your aperture down a little more (without changing any other settings) than you could without.",6/8/2015

This CP filter will darken the image, but not too much. Sometimes it's hard to get the polarization effect, but if you're perpendicular to the light source (sun), you can sometimes get the effect, which can make your video look nicer - especially clouds and water. The effect is subtle enough to appear real and still add to the overall image quality. The quality of the threads is great and the rotating ring is how a rotating ring should feel - not too tight, not too loose.

In contrast, most so-called \\""UV filters\\"" don't block enough UV light to make a difference in your photos.<br /><br />This filter eliminates purple fringing when used on my Olympus Micro Four Thirds cameras. This is the filter to get if you hate purple fringing and you think that the tools available to correct it in Lightroom aren't as good as eliminating the problem at the source.<br /><br />Tiffen appears to make perfectly fine high-quality uncoated filters. I can't see paying six times the price for a B+W filter that does the same thing. As long as the sun isn't shining on the filter, I can't detect any loss of image quality with this filter on the camera.<br /><br />On the other hand, because it's uncoated, if the sun is outside the frame but nevertheless shining on the filter, it causes pretty massive ghosting. However, there's no company making a coated version of this type of filter, so this is the best you're going to get, and at a bargain price.<br /><br />I don't recommend using this filter under artificial lighting, because artificial lights don't give off much UV, therefore this filter can't help your image quality under those circumstances, it can only hurt it.<br /><br />It's too bad Tiffen doesn't make these in smaller sizes for mirrorless cameras. I need to use a step-up ring with the 52mm size.<br /><br />UPDATE: Unfortunately, I have seen other instances where this filter caused significant ghosting besides the obvious shooting into the sun. Such as shooting from a dark street into the light on a cloudy overcast day. So the lesson I learned is that one can't assume that this filter will always improve outdoor photos.",8/25/2013

ND filters allow you to shoot with a wide aperture without over-exposing your images. While you can stop down your lens to compensate for bright lighting, you will increase your depth of field and loose the &#34;bokeh&#34; -background blur - of the wider aperture. An ND filter allows you to shoot with aperture open, maintain a shallow depth of field (desirable for video) keep the details in the highlights and preserve a nice color balance. ND filters can cost $100+ but this Tiffen does a great job a fraction of the cost. I use it for still and video images and I'm very satisfied with the results.

You take a shot. The sky is brilliant deep blue, the clouds brilliant white, and the water is so clear you can see the rocks on the bottom. HOW? Simple, use a polarizer. With today's TTL metering (through the lens) and circular grooving of the surface of the polarizer, there's no twisting to get it to the right angle, and there's no sweating if it will throw the exposure off. Just POINT and SHOOT and love the results. First thing I do with a new camera is put a UV or SKYLIGHT filter on the lens, insurance. Second thing is add a polarizer to inventory. In snow shots, water shots, scenery with blue skies and clouds the filter is magic. And it does all the work. Should be in every photographer's gadget bag. It's in every serious photographer's bag, that I am sure of. It will remove reflections when you shoot through windows. It will add richness and depth to the colors of photographed cars.

Comes in a solid clear plastic box suitable for storing filter (no #$(&^ clamshell).  The one I received rotates smoothly.

Update: The Above review was for the 62mm filter. Since then I purchased the 67mm filter for a new lens.  The minute I tried to open it, the opening tap on the plastic box broke off making the holder absolutely useless.

Once I get some video cut together, I'll post a clip... for now, see the two pics I posted. Above water you can see the clouds are pink... below water you see the water/fish look less green. Both pics are split-screen and I didn't label the split, because... it's obvious.<br /><br />By now I'm sure you've noticed that dive filters for a GoPro are expensive. Considering the cost in getting to a dive/snorkel destination, I think that expense is probably worth it, so you may want to consider that as part of my review... i.e. is this the PERFECT solution to CC (color correct) the greenish-turquoise Caribbean water? Probably not, but as you'll see, it seems to do a lot for the low cost. When I looked through the GoPro LCD monitor, I was a little bummed that it didn't take more of the green out of the water, but checking at home, I'm actually completely satisfied. Sure, there's still some green tint to the images... mostly as you look off into more and/or deeper water, but I can live with it... and you could make the argument that it's actually nice, as it gives a touch of the real environment vs. 100% \\""fixed\\"" to clear. I'm not even sure if the professional dive filters fix the color 100% beyond things seen in the near-field anyway(?)<br /><br />I chose this filter based on normal film and camera knowledge... that you correct the green cast of a fluorescent with a \\""minus green\\"" filter or gel... and assumed this filter would do at least something to that effect. Notice I said \\""decent\\"" but not \\""perfect\\"". If you're DIVING... and not simply snorkeling, you may need the additional tint but looking at my results on a monitor, I'm happy... and for the price of these FL-D filters vs. the standard \\""dive\\"" filters... you can buy a couple and have a spare.<br /><br />If you use this with a GoPro you'll want to give your camera a little shake underwater and look at it to be sure bubbles aren't trapped in front of the camera protective housing lens and this filter, but aside from that... the results I'm seeing warrant 5 stars for this filter. I'm sure that most GoPro owners aren't even considering this for CC in water... but it's actually quite a bargain and we're lucky to have this as a low-cost option to do much (if not most) of what the purpose-branded filters do.<br /><br />I've always enjoyed discovering inexpensive products to re-purpose when I feel trapped into paying a premium for niche' products... and in my opinion, this is one of 'em. (An SRP adapter isn't cheap, for a bit of plastic, but I consider them a necessity to get the most out of a GoPro already... so not much I can say there... but at least you don't also have to pay a ton for each filter on top of that)...<br /><br />Oh... and no vignetting on a GoPro Hero 3 with this filter either, just like all the 55mm Tiffen ND filters (which you should also have, if you have a Hero 3... at least the .6 anyway).",3/15/2014

There are advantages to Tiffen's method; because gelatins are extremely thin, they are still the gold standard for optical quality, the color of gelatins is extremely precise and they are available in an enormous range.  This last point is why I ended up with this 29 filter but I'll get to that in a minute.<br /><br />The drawbacks to sandwiches are double the number of glass surfaces, the potential for problems with the optical cement that holds the gelatin and while not directly related, the fact that Tiffen doesn't seem to do much in the way of anti-reflective coatings which has become more of an issue with digital cameras.<br /><br />But I needed a dark red filter.  Hoya, who makes perfectly good filters (including Nikon's and Canon's) no longer makes a 29.  I tried a B+W 091 which is roughly equivalent but not identical and the Tiffen worked better.  The first Tiffen 29 I got showed a bright reflection at the edge which turned out to be tiny chip of glass.  The second one had a fine white dust at the edge which on close examination was glass as well.  The black paint on the rim wasn't great either but that shouldn't cause any problems.<br /><br />So if you need a filter, try Hoya or Kenko first.  They're the world's largest manufacturer of optical glass so they know what they are doing.  I've never found B+W or Heliopan offer any real, practical or optical advantages but they're excellent products, too.  And if the filter you need isn't available from any of these guys, buy a Tiffen.",8/3/2013

Irreplaceable when you need it for ""that shot""!","Tiffen 62mm color graduated neutral density 0.6 filter works like a charm literally. If you have ever shot images during daylight and have them look unbalanced-either by overexposing the sky leaving the foreground of the subject dark and underexposed or overexposing the foreground resulting in an overly blurry overexposed sky that has no details whatsoever.<br /><br />Tiffen 62mm color graduated neutral density 0.6 filter provides the solution of creating a balance between two areas within a space. Neutral density filters that are in the range of 0.6 to clear are often used to balance off the sky and the foreground. Mostly suitable for outdoor photography, this filter ensures that the clarity of the sky can be distinguished from the foreground of the subject. Perfect for the beach, sunrise and sunset shots. One can also rotate the filter to choose which parts of the frame they want darkened. The outcome is great depth in the pictures, color distinction and controlled exposure.<br /><br />Although this filter is good for daylight outdoor photography, it still could come in handy if one wants to shoot black and white photos. All one has to do is position the dark part of the filter to correspond to the light area of the subject. It can also be used to take shots of the moon and the stars over a hill or mountain at dusk. Without a filter, the sky will be over exposed and the hill or mountain underexposed but with a filter both are exposed and well balanced. This is definitely the filter that will allow you to get a clear definition of the sky and surrounding landscape. Going for only $62.90 this filter should be in every camera bag.<br /><br />The build quality of Tiffen filter is good since it is made from glass. Some Cokin filters for example are made from plastic which scratches easily. The threads on the Tiffen filter also makes it easy to fit and remove from the lens. Worries of damaging the lens will never arise while using this lens. There is however one drawback with the Tiffen neutral density filter.<br /><br />It doesnΓÇÖt fit seamlessly with the Canon lens. A little hard to get on there, in my personal opinion. Hopefully Tiffen will rectify this mechanical issue.  Also,it can be tricky when it comes to partitioning between the filtered and unfiltered areas. This though can be overcome with regular practice. Other than that, Tiffen never disappoints and one can be confident that they will get their value for money with this neutral density 0.6 filter.k with the Tiffen neutral density filter.<br /><br />It doesnΓÇÖt fit seamlessly with the Canon lens.

Very uncivilized yet beautiful and FUN.<br />Tiffen is a great brandΓÇª  and It will protect your lens - somewhat!<br /><br />Read what Robert M. Atkins says on Photo.net after much testing on Hoya, Tiffen and the like:<br /><br />&#34;ΓÇªUVΓÇª why would be want to block it? Well the answer lies in the way that color film works. There are basically three color sensitive layers, one sensitive to red light, one to green light and one to blue light. The blue layer not only responds to blue light, but also to UV light, so if there is a lot of UV around the blue sensitive layer gets extra exposure and the final image takes on a blue color. Since film isn't normally sensitive to infrared, you don't need an infrared blocking filter. Interestingly though, digital sensors are infrared sensitive and most digital cameras have an infrared blocking filter built in.<br />  Now there isn't usually a huge amount of UV around at sea level. There is some (that's what gives you a suntan or a sunburn) but most of it is scattered by the atmosphere. However as you gain altitude, for example by going up a mountain, the amount of UV increases. Under these conditions a UV filter can prevent a blue cast in photographs.<br /><br />Since UV filters look clear and neutral to the naked eye, some people also use them as a protective filter which they leave on their lens at all times. Some people think this is a good idea, other question the wisdom placing a $20 filter in front of a $1000 lens and potentially affecting image quality. Both schools of thought have some valid points. It's your choice.<br /><br />...What I actually use when I need a UV filter or a protective filter is a Tiffen 812. Usually, for the type of work I do, a warmer image isn't a problem, indeed it's often desirable. I also like to minimize the number of filters I carry so my 812 serves three functions. It blocks UV, it protects the lens and it's a warming filter. Some people use an 81B for this, but I slightly prefer the color shift of the 812. Not everyone wants a warming filter, so the clear winner for a neutral filter that really bocks UV is the Tiffen Haze-1, though the Hoya UV should also be pretty effective. &#34;",8/29/2014

If your forte is that of photography, then you ought to get this Tiffen 62mm neutral density 0.9 filter.<br /><br />This a must have filter goes for an average measly $15.99. Great for shooting at wide apertures especially during bright daylights or a prolonged coverage of topography. This neutral density filter is also very useful for panning, rivers and waterfall shots.<br /><br />It prevents the water from looking blurry and misty by reducing the light coming through the lens which slows down the shutter speed thereby reducing the aforementioned blurring thus retaining the color of the subject. It allows one to shoot at f/2.8 with a 180 degree shutter speed at round about 24 FPS (Frames per second) for videos. It is also worth noting that the Tiffen filter doesnΓÇÖt vignette. To get even more desirable effects, it is advisable to use a tripod.<br /><br />This is because the filter thrusts the shutter speed into several seconds. The filter is also great for producing blurred motion upshots. This can be achieved by slowing the shutter speed. It also reduces out of depth effect that results from wide lens coverage by obscuring the subjects foreground and background. The build quality is immaculate.<br /><br />The filterΓÇÖs frame is made from metal and the glass is of superb quality which equates to sturdiness.  Unlike a filter like Vivitar which is known to at times throw off the cameras white balance leading to purple like images, this filter doesnΓÇÖt throw off the camera white balance. The good-looking plastic package that comes with the filter acts as a great future storage pack for the filter.<br /><br />Unfortunately this filter is not for everyone. It does not fit on some Sony Camera like the Sony 6. It is also not very dark compared to other neutral density filters. If not handled with care, the Tiffen filter is likely to be scratched. Although this is not an isolated case as most filters suffer from the same as well.<br /><br />This filter is great for bright daylight shots since it doesnΓÇÖt change the color of the subject. But for prolonged exposure during the daylight, HoyaΓÇÖs 77mm neutral density does the trick since TiffenΓÇÖs filter is not dark enough to stop the image from being over exposed to light.  Also, because the filter is not multi-coated, flaring is eminent. But then TiffenΓÇÖs 62mm neutral density filter is a worthy filter that is affordable and does what it says it will do.<br /><br />As somebody who shoots on a Canon 5D MKIII and MKII I really must advocate for this $15 (soooo cheap!) upgrade to your photographic experience.s filter is great for bright daylight shots since it doesnΓÇÖt change the color of the subject.

It looks like I will have to pay double the price to get a similar product that has a better non-reflecting surface.",8/23/2013

Apparently the front of the ring where another filter would screw in is just a little too short and the lens cap doesn't get a good bite on the threads.

I recently purchased a higher quality $80 polarizer from a filter competitor, and in terms of build quality, feel, ease of dialing, and attaching/removing from my lens, you can just tell the difference.  I wish I had saved the money on this purchase and applied it to the second filter from the beginning.  But for the bad threads on my copy, this probably is a good value, but there are several subtle differences that have me preferring the more expensive filter over this one.  I generally try and use less expensive equipment when I can, so if yours is mechanically working ok, great.  If I had an opportunity to compare both in my hand at the same time at point of purchase, I'm pretty sure I would have sacrificed my wallet and purchased the more expensive filter originally.",8/21/2014

The biggest challenge is eliminating unnecessary vignetting that can not be eliminated--even with pain-staking efforts--in the development process (I use Lightroom, Photoshop, and a full suite of Topaz products). The real challenge is the vignetting is tough to pick up through your view finder and in reviewing it on the camera monitor. Despite all of that, it is capable of toning down sun-drenched objects, and in bringing out brilliant colors. My best advice for the Tiffen is to shoot wider then you normally would when using it, and shoot more photos of the same subject and angle than you thought necessary.",8/10/2013

This cannot have happened due to any handling problems from the vendors because they filters are packed in sealed, hard plastic cases.<br /><br />Two of these filters had some sort of advertising, (printed on a post-it type piece of paper) INSIDE the hard filter case. The filter has some room to move about inside the case, so during shipment the paper rubbed against the glass and caused damage.  Any manufacturer of optical components should know that normal paper is like sandpaper to glass and optical coatings.<br /><br />The other two I received were dirty to the extent that I thought they were used and returned, but they were in cases with unbroken seals from Tiffen.<br /><br />I can't really offer a fair review of the quality of the product due to the above problems.

It will reduce the amount of light entering your lens but is not dark enough to get that really slow shutter speed under bright light conditions.  Even with the ISO turned down to the slowest setting and the f-stop at the slowest (f-22 or so) you might not be able to get what you are looking for.  When shooting under overcast sky or near dusk this works pretty well.  If you are looking for really slow shutter, with the ability to control your depth of field I would suggest stacking more than one.<br />Unless you are looking for graduated ND filters I would suggest this over the square slide ins as this doesn't allow light to reflect off the back side of the glass (or plastic in cheaper models).<br />At this price I would suggest getting this along with at least one more of the same or a lower density to allow for more flexibility.<br />Overall highly recommended for those wanting to get creative with their photography and do stuff you just can do in PS.",8/11/2013

I would recommend this to anyone looking for a decent pocket friendly ND filter. I use it for my 24-85mm kit lens of Nikon D600 to get good smooth water surface.

Yes, you can do some long exposures, but these are not dark enough if you are thinking of doing a long exposure in broad daylight. I purchased this thinking it would be dark enough, but I was unable to get the exposure long enough without the image being too over exposed in daylight. I ended up buying the Hoya 77mm Neutral Density ND-400 HMC Filter which was exactly what I needed to get the long exposures in daylight. This filter would be great for video to allow you to get a wider aperture on a bright day, or maybe long exposures on cloudy days or late in the evening.But if you are looking to get smooth milky waterfalls on a bright sunny day, this filter will not suffice. As far as the actual filter, it is a solid quality filter if you are on a budget and gets you great photos if you know how to use it. Great option for what it was made for.",8/12/2014

Like all gradient filters of its type, it's half clear and half darker - you can't adjust that.

Is it worth extra $124? I donΓÇÖt think so. I think I wasted $124.<br />I am keeping both, but I will have to now rate B+W XS-Pro Kaesemann CP.<br />Having Tiffen for $24.95 makes BWΓÇÖs price to  performance ratio 1 star ΓÇô 1 for smooth rotation.<br />The rest is the same ΓÇô I canΓÇÖt see the difference between Tiffen and BW shots (blown up to actual pixels size on HP ZR2440w).<br />If I didnΓÇÖt have Tiffen at all I would have rated B+W 5 stars..<br />It may change -  all I did was just a 100 test shots on a sunny day on the beach.<br />I donΓÇÖt think  IΓÇÖll be using polarizers in any other setting anytime soon.<br />So if you are debating this Tiffen v.s. B+W ΓÇô donΓÇÖt.  Just buy it!",3/9/2014

My lens is a 28-300 vr fx so the filter had both to be accessible and not alter the cameras ability to focus.<br />This filter does an excellent job if used properly in landscape, however I would recommend removing the filter once you have finished as you can get some unexpected results if you use it indoors or with flash.",9/22/2013

I'm not entirely sold on that, though. There've been a few shots with a lot of glare or a really bright sky where it's helped - and there's been just as many shots where it seemed like it was helping, only to cause the photo to look horrendous and unnatural once I loaded it onto my computer.<br /><br />Perhaps I just need to get better at learning when to use it and when not to, but it seems that much of the benefit of this filter can be achieved by shooting in RAW and doing a bit of creative curve-balancing in Lightroom.",11/22/2013
